location: Monk's|JERRY|So you like her?
location: Monk's|GEORGE|I think so.
location: Monk's|JERRY|You don't know?
location: Monk's|GEORGE|I can't tell anymore.
location: Monk's|JERRY|Well do you feel anything?
location: Monk's|GEORGE|Feel? What's that?
location: Monk's|JERRY|All right, let me ask you this: when she comes over, you're cleaning up a lot?
location: Monk's|GEORGE|Yeah.
location: Monk's|JERRY|You're just straightening up or you're cleaning?
location: Monk's|GEORGE|Cleaning
location: Monk's|JERRY|You do the tub?
location: Monk's|GEORGE|Yeah.
location: Monk's|JERRY|On your knees, Ajax, hands scrubbin', the whole deal?

location: Monk's|GEORGE|Yep. There's one liiiittle problem.
location: Monk's|JERRY|Sexual?
location: Monk's|GEORGE|Yeeeaaah. (Jerry and George lean in to make their conversation a little more private) Well..... I've never really felt confident in uh..... one particular aspect.
location: Monk's|JERRY|Below the equator?
location: Monk's|GEORGE|Yeah.
location: Monk's|JERRY|Nobody does. You know, nobody knows what to do. You just close your eyes and you hope for the best. I really think they're happy if you just make an effort.
location: Monk's|GEORGE|I-I don't know. Last time I got the tap.
location: Monk's|JERRY|You got the tap?
location: Monk's|GEORGE|You know, you're going along, you think everything's all right and all of a sudden you get that tap. (George taps his own shoulder). You know it's like pfffff (whistling sound), all right that's enough, you're through.
location: Monk's|JERRY|The tap is tough.
location: Monk's|GEORGE|It's like the manager coming out and asking you for the ball.
location: Monk's|JERRY|Well maybe she just wanted to move on to other business.
location: Monk's|GEORGE|No, no, this wasn't moving on. I got the hook. I wish I could get a lesson in that.
location: Monk's|JERRY|It's a very complicated area.
location: Monk's|GEORGE|You can go crazy trying to figure that place out.
location: Monk's|JERRY|It's a haaazy mystery.
location: Monk's|GEORGE|Anyway, I think everything else is okay. Unless of course she's faking.
location: Monk's|action|Elaine joins them
location: Monk's|ELAINE|Who's faking?
location: Monk's|GEORGE|Nothing.
location: Monk's|ELAINE|Faking what?
location: Monk's|GEORGE|Nobody's faking.
location: Monk's|ELAINE|Ah! Orgasm?
location: Monk's|GEORGE|She's not faking!
location: Monk's|ELAINE|How do you know?
location: Monk's|GEORGE|I know. I can tell. It's one of my powers. Why, did you ever fake?
location: Monk's|ELAINE|Of course.
location: Monk's|JERRY|Really?
location: Monk's|GEORGE|You faked?
location: Monk's|ELAINE|On occasion.
location: Monk's|JERRY|And the guy never knows?
location: Monk's|ELAINE|No.
location: Monk's|JERRY|How can he not know that?
location: Monk's|ELAINE|Because I was gooood.
location: Monk's|JERRY|I guess after that many beers he's probably a little groggy anyway.
location: Monk's|action|Jerry and George laugh
location: Monk's|ELAINE|You didn't know.
location: Monk's|JERRY|What?
location: Monk's|ELAINE|You didn't know.
location: Monk's|JERRY|Are you saying...
location: Monk's|action|George clears his throat and calls a waitress
location: Monk's|GEORGE|I think I'll have a piece of cake.
location: Monk's|JERRY|With me?
location: Monk's|ELAINE|Well...
location: Monk's|JERRY|You faked with me?
location: Monk's|ELAINE|Ye.
location: Monk's|JERRY|You faked with me?
location: Monk's|ELAINE|Yeass.
location: Monk's|JERRY|No.
location: Monk's|ELAINE|Yeass.
location: Monk's|JERRY|You faked it?
location: Monk's|ELAINE|I faked it.
location: Monk's|JERRY|That whole thing, the whole production, it was all an act?
location: Monk's|ELAINE|Not bad huh?
location: Monk's|JERRY|What about the breathing, the panting, the moaning, the screaming?
location: Monk's|ELAINE|(points in the air as is to point out each things Jerry asked) Fake, fake, fake, fake.
location: Monk's|JERRY|I'm stunned, I'm shocked! How many times did you do this?
location: Monk's|ELAINE|Uuuhm, all the time.
location: Monk's|JERRY|All the time?!
location: Monk's|GEORGE|We got a chocolate malt in here!
location: Monk's|JERRY|But I'm so good.
location: Monk's|GEORGE|I'm sure you are.
location: Monk's|ELAINE|Jerry, listen, it wasn't you. I just didn't have 'em back then.
location: Monk's|JERRY|She faked.
location: Monk's|action|George smiles sarcastically
location: Monk's|JERRY|Maybe they've all been faking.
location: Monk's|ELAINE|I'm sure they're not.
location: Monk's|GEORGE|Maybe Karen is faking.
location: Jerry's apartment|action|Kramer is lighting his cigar on the stove
location: Jerry's apartment|KRAMER|She was probably joking.
location: Jerry's apartment|JERRY|No no, it was no joke.
location: Jerry's apartment|KRAMER|She didn't have any?
location: Jerry's apartment|JERRY|No. None.
location: Jerry's apartment|KRAMER|(raising hand) She faked 'em all.
location: Jerry's apartment|JERRY|(raising hand) Faked 'em all.
location: Jerry's apartment|KRAMER|Well so she faked 'em, so what?
location: Jerry's apartment|JERRY|The woman had an orgasm under false pretences. That's sexual perjury.
location: Jerry's apartment|KRAMER|You know I heard her screaming from my apartment? She woke me up a few times.
location: Jerry's apartment|JERRY|How did she do it? She's like Meryl Streep this woman. And I had to work the equipment. I'm not unskilled, I'm in the union. If she'd at least told me, maybe I could have done something about it.
location: Jerry's apartment|KRAMER|Yeah I could have helped you out.
location: Jerry's apartment|JERRY|What could you have done?
location: Jerry's apartment|KRAMER|I could have given you some pointers. I know how to press those buttons buddy.
location: Jerry's apartment|JERRY|I'm feeling very inadequate about the whole thing.
location: Jerry's apartment|KRAMER|Aaaaah.
location: Jerry's apartment|JERRY|Don't aaaaah! I'm supposed to do something with her later? I don't even think I wanna see her.
location: Jerry's apartment|action|The phone rings

location: Jerry's apartment|ELAINE|Why? What's wrong? You're not still thinking about this afternoon are you?
location: Jerry's apartment|JERRY|What, the grilled cheese? Naaah, they always burn the toast.
location: Jerry's apartment|ELAINE|Nooo, the other thing.
location: Jerry's apartment|JERRY|Oooh that. Well...
location: Jerry's apartment|ELAINE|Oh come on, Jerry. Making to much of a big deal about it.

location: Elaine's office|action|Elaine hangs up the phone; Rene walks passed the office
location: Elaine's office|ELAINE|Rene, can you come here a second? Let me ask you something: Ummm, have you ever... you know... faked it?
location: Elaine's office|RENE|Yeah, sometimes.
location: Elaine's office|ELAINE|Really, like when?
location: Elaine's office|RENE|Like if we went to a Broadway show, if we had really good seats. (Elaine is sitting there, jaw opened shaking her head yes) Well you know, if it's enough all ready and I just wanna get some sleep.
location: Jerry's apartment|action|Resume at the point Jerry hangs up his phone from the conversation with Elaine
location: Jerry's apartment|JERRY|I really don't feel like seeing her.

location: Jerry's apartment|KRAMER|Yeah.
location: Jerry's apartment|JERRY|You faked it? Why would you do that?
location: Jerry's apartment|KRAMER|Well you know, if it's enough already and I just wanna get some sleep.
location: Jerry's apartment|JERRY|Yeah, but why would you... (Kramer is eating a peach then disgusted he spits it out) Bad peach?
location: Jerry's apartment|KRAMER|It's terrible!
location: Jerry's apartment|JERRY|Did you get that at Joe's?
location: Jerry's apartment|KRAMER|Yeah, of course I got it at Joe's.
location: Jerry's apartment|JERRY|That's surprising, his fruit is usually the best.
location: Jerry's apartment|KRAMER|You know what I'm gonna do? (heading for the door) I'm gonna return this.
location: Jerry's apartment|JERRY|You're returning used fruit?
location: Jerry's apartment|KRAMER|Jerry this peach is sub par.
location: Jerry's apartment|action|Kramer exits
location: Joe's|JOE|So what do you want me to do?
location: Joe's|KRAMER|I want restitution.
location: Joe's|JOE|Restitution? You want restitution? Why should I give you restitution?
location: Joe's|KRAMER|Because it's no good.
location: Joe's|JOE|When you put that fruit out, that's where it ends for me.
location: Joe's|KRAMER|It's still your fruit, you gotta stand behind your fruit.
location: Joe's|JOE|I stand behind my fruit.
location: Joe's|KRAMER|So...
location: Joe's|JOE|Hey, you got a bad peach? That's an act of God. He makes the peaches. I don't make the peaches, I sell the peaches. You have a problem? You talk to him.
location: Joe's|KRAMER|You know this whole place is going vrrrrrrrrrrrrt, downhill. I could have come in here last week with a bad plum but I let it go.
location: Joe's|JOE|Well let me put a solution for ya: do your business elsewhere, I don't want your business.
location: Joe's|KRAMER|Oh now you don't want my business.
location: Joe's|JOE|No, I don't want your business and from this moment you're banned from the store, you're banned!

location: restaurant|KAREN|I'm very satisfied.
location: restaurant|GEORGE|I-I'm sure if you weren't satisfied you would probably say something wouldn't you?
location: restaurant|KAREN|I probably would. But then again I'm an enigma.
location: restaurant|GEORGE|Hey listen... umm, instead of the movie... uh, maybe we'll go back and uh you know...(nudges her head with his head)
location: restaurant|KAREN|Maybe.
location: restaurant|GEORGE|So... uh you feel okay about that whole thing... what we do in there... you're generally okay with everything in there?

location: (another) restaurant|JERRY|Ah, she's okay.
location: (another) restaurant|ELAINE|I love her Jerry, she's so authentic. I really believe everything is actually happening to her. There's no acting there.

location: (another) restaurant|action|Calls for the waiter
location: (another) restaurant|ELAINE|I really admire actors, you know. It's just such an incredible skill.

location: (another) restaurant|ELAINE|Ya, Yes we will!

location: (another) restaurant|JERRY|Okay, fifteen minutes. I guarantee you fifteen minutes, I can make it happen!

location: (another) restaurant|ELAINE|What, no, it doesn't matter. Jerry, I don't care.
location: (another) restaurant|JERRY|That's it, that's it. You like having this over me, you don't want me to do it.
location: (another) restaurant|ELAINE|That is so ridiculous.
location: (another) restaurant|JERRY|Come on, Elaine!
location: (another) restaurant|ELAINE|No.

location: Jerry's car|JERRY|You're a baby!
location: Jerry's car|ELAINE|You're a baby!
location: Jerry's apartment|GEORGE|It's all your fault! You and Elaine! All that orgasm talk. She did have an orgasm, she didn't have an orgasm. Orgasm this, orgasm that. I got so focused on it. I started to panic and boom, I lost it. I tried everything, I was talking to him: 'Please wake up, do something.'
location: Jerry's apartment|JERRY|They're mysterious little fellows aren't they?
location: Jerry's apartment|GEORGE|I hate him!
location: Jerry's apartment|JERRY|You know it happens to everybody. It happened to Houdini. And he could get out of a trunk under water with his hands in chains! But he had a problem with that. The miracle is that it ever happens.
location: Jerry's apartment|GEORGE|It's like a magic trick. Sometimes I think it would be easier to bend a spoon mentally than to make that transformation.
location: Jerry's apartment|action|Kramer enters

location: Jerry's apartment|KRAMER|Jerry, what am I gonna do for fruit?
location: Jerry's apartment|JERRY|Well you'll have to go to the supermarket.
location: Jerry's apartment|KRAMER|The supermarket? That's impossible! They don't have a decent piece of fruit at the supermarket. The apples are mealy, the oranges are dry. I don't know what's going on with the Papayas! Jerry you gotta go to Joe's, you gotta get me some fruit!
location: Jerry's apartment|JERRY|Oh so what I'm going to buy all your fruit now?
