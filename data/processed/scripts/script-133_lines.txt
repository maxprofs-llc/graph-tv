Setting: The Coffee Shop|ELAINE|Mm-hmm.
Setting: The Coffee Shop|JERRY|You know, I have a little thing for Beth Lookner.
Setting: The Coffee Shop|ELAINE|Well, I have to admit, I've always thought David was kind of sponge-worthy. (Winks, making a clicking sound with her tongue)

Setting: Jerry's apartment|KRAMER|(Fixing up his pants) Yeah.. look at this, Mickey. These pants are fallin' apart, huh?
Setting: Jerry's apartment|JERRY|(Fishing for his keys in a kitchen drawer) You know, when I first met you, Kramer, you used to wear jeans all the time.
Setting: Jerry's apartment|KRAMER|(Looking over Mickey's shoulder at the script) Yeah, well, I was a different man then.
Setting: Jerry's apartment|JERRY|(Jokingly playing off Kramer's statement) With a different body.
Setting: Jerry's apartment|KRAMER|(Slightly offended) Hey, I got the body of a.. taught, pre-teen, Swedish boy.
Setting: Jerry's apartment|action|Mickey visibly rolls his eyes
Setting: Jerry's apartment|JERRY|Ehh, I dunno..
Setting: Jerry's apartment|KRAMER|Now, what are you thinkin'? (Getting upset) You think that I'm not able to wear jeans anymore? Is that what you're sayin'?

Setting: Monk's coffee shop|ELAINE|Right.
Setting: Monk's coffee shop|JERRY|It's like when tenant dies in a rent controlled building - you gotta take immediate action.
