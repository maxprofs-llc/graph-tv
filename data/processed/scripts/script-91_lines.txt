New scene - Jerry and Elaine at Poppie's Restaurant.|ELAINE|Is that something?
New scene - Jerry and Elaine at Poppie's Restaurant.|JERRY|Yes.
New scene - Jerry and Elaine at Poppie's Restaurant.|ELAINE|Is that something?
New scene - Jerry and Elaine at Poppie's Restaurant.|JERRY|You're something. So anyway, when they were in my house before, I didn't offer them anything to drink.
New scene - Jerry and Elaine at Poppie's Restaurant.|ELAINE|Well, they're real men, Jerry. They get sweaty.
New scene - Jerry and Elaine at Poppie's Restaurant.|JERRY|So, anyone sweaty comes into your house has to be offered a drink?
New scene - Jerry and Elaine at Poppie's Restaurant.|ELAINE|Yes.
New scene - Jerry and Elaine at Poppie's Restaurant.|JERRY|Well, would you apologize for me? (Elaine nods. Poppie comes out of the kitchen.)

New scene - Jerry and Elaine at Poppie's Restaurant.|JERRY|Well, Kramer told us all about your business venture together.
New scene - Jerry and Elaine at Poppie's Restaurant.|POPPIE|Your friend and I are going to make a lot of money. Of course, I already have a lot of money. Poppie does very well...very well.
New scene - Jerry and Elaine at Poppie's Restaurant.|ELAINE|Well, your mother must be very proud of you.
New scene - Jerry and Elaine at Poppie's Restaurant.|POPPIE|My mother...was taken from my house by the Communists in the middle of the night when I was ten years old. She was sent to a slave labor camp, where she labored for twelve years. Finally, they released her and she was on a boat to America to re-unite with us...but she was served some bad fish, and she died...on the high seas.
New scene - Jerry and Elaine at Poppie's Restaurant.|JERRY|So, what's good tonight?
Cut back to Jerry and Elaine at Poppie's.|ELAINE|Boy, I'm really looking forward to this duck. I've never had food ordered in advance before.
Cut back to Jerry and Elaine at Poppie's.|JERRY|Ah, I could've stayed home and ordered a pizza from Paccino's.
Cut back to Jerry and Elaine at Poppie's.|ELAINE|Paccino's? Oh no. You should never order pizza from Paccino's.
Cut back to Jerry and Elaine at Poppie's.|JERRY|Why not?
Cut back to Jerry and Elaine at Poppie's.|ELAINE|Because, the owner contributes a lot of money to those fanatical, anti-abortion groups.
Cut back to Jerry and Elaine at Poppie's.|JERRY|So, you won't eat the pizza?
Cut back to Jerry and Elaine at Poppie's.|ELAINE|No way.
Cut back to Jerry and Elaine at Poppie's.|JERRY|Really.
Cut back to Jerry and Elaine at Poppie's.|ELAINE|Yeah.
Cut back to Jerry and Elaine at Poppie's.|JERRY|Well, what if Poppie felt the same way?
Cut back to Jerry and Elaine at Poppie's.|ELAINE|Well, I guess I wouldn't eat here, then.
Cut back to Jerry and Elaine at Poppie's.|JERRY|Really!
Cut back to Jerry and Elaine at Poppie's.|ELAINE|Yeah. That's right.
Cut back to Jerry and Elaine at Poppie's.|JERRY|Well, perhaps we should inquire. Poppie! Oh, Poppie. Could I have a word? (Poppie comes over.)
Cut back to Jerry and Elaine at Poppie's.|POPPIE|Yes, Jerry. I just checked your duck...it is more succulent than even I had hoped.
Cut back to Jerry and Elaine at Poppie's.|JERRY|Poppie, I was just curious...where do you stand on the abortion issue?
Cut back to Jerry and Elaine at Poppie's.|POPPIE|When my mother was abducted by the Communists, she was with child...
Cut back to Jerry and Elaine at Poppie's.|JERRY|Oh, boy.
Cut back to Jerry and Elaine at Poppie's.|POPPIE|...but the Communists, they put an end to that! So, on this issue there is no debate! And no intelligent person can think differently.
Cut back to Jerry and Elaine at Poppie's.|POPPIE|And what gives you the right to do that?
Cut back to Jerry and Elaine at Poppie's.|HENRY|But we just got here...
Cut back to Jerry and Elaine at Poppie's.|POPPIE|You're not welcome!
Cut back to Jerry and Elaine at Poppie's.|JERRY|Well, I'm certainly glad I brought it up. (Gets up and leaves.)
