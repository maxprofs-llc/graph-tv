Setting: Jerry's apartment|action|Jerry and George enter with some plastic bags
Setting: Jerry's apartment|JERRY|She hasn't told her father yet?
Setting: Jerry's apartment|GEORGE|No. We're supposed to tell him tonight.
Setting: Jerry's apartment|JERRY|"We're"? What do you mean, "We're"?
Setting: Jerry's apartment|GEORGE|Susan wants me to be there.
Setting: Jerry's apartment|JERRY|You're meetin' the father for the first time?
Setting: Jerry's apartment|GEORGE|(Reluctantly) Yeah.
Setting: Jerry's apartment|JERRY|(Chuckles slightly) Well, you'll make quite an impression on him when you tell him how you burned his cabin down.
Setting: Jerry's apartment|GEORGE|I didn't burn it down - Kramer did!
Setting: Jerry's apartment|JERRY|(Laughs) I mean, the whole thing is ironic. Think of it: Here the guy is nice enough to give you a box of very fine Cuban cigars..
Setting: Jerry's apartment|GEORGE|Yeah, I know what happened.
Setting: Jerry's apartment|JERRY|No, but wait, wait: And then you dump them off onto Kramer..
Setting: Jerry's apartment|GEORGE|(Getting frustrated) I know.
Setting: Jerry's apartment|JERRY|(Continuing) ..Who, who proceeds to burn the man's cabin down with one of those very same cigars! (Topping off his observation) It's very comical..
Setting: Jerry's apartment|GEORGE|Listen, maybe we shouldn't start writing today. I got a lot on my mind.
Setting: Jerry's apartment|JERRY|(Persisting) No, no, we put this off long enough. Today's the day.
Setting: Jerry's apartment|GEORGE|(Letting his conscious get the best of him) I wonder how Susan's father's going to react to this. Alright, what- what's the worst he could do? So you burn a cabin down..
Setting: Jerry's apartment|JERRY|(Agreeing) C'mon. It's not even a house - it's, like, a cabin.
Setting: Jerry's apartment|GEORGE|We could build a cabin like (Snaps) that.
Setting: Jerry's apartment|JERRY|(Blunt) Well, maybe not us, but two men could.
Setting: Jerry's apartment|GEORGE|(Looking over the writing materials they just bought) Bics? What, d'ja get, bics?
Setting: Jerry's apartment|JERRY|What, you got a problem with the pen now?
Setting: Jerry's apartment|GEORGE|Well, I like a rolling writer. They're very smooth.
Setting: Jerry's apartment|JERRY|Alright, let's just get to work. (They both move into the living room - ready to start writing their script. Jerry sits down) NBC Pilot, Seinfeld project. Act I, Scene A.
Setting: Jerry's apartment|GEORGE|(Still standing) So, you're gonna sit there?
Setting: Jerry's apartment|JERRY|(Wanting to get started) Just - just park yourself. (George reluctantly sits on the sofa) Alright. Act I, Scene A.
Setting: Jerry's apartment|GEORGE|(Offering) Drink?
Setting: Jerry's apartment|JERRY|No, no thank you.
Setting: Jerry's apartment|GEORGE|(Uncapping his pen) Alright, here we go.
Setting: Jerry's apartment|JERRY|Act I, Scene A..
Setting: Jerry's apartment|action|A long pause as they both attempt to start writing passes
Setting: Jerry's apartment|GEORGE|Weren't you supposed to call Elaine?
Setting: Jerry's apartment|JERRY|(Eagerly reaching for the phone) Yes. (George turns the TV on, and begins watching as Jerry dials the number) Hi, is Elaine there? Oh, uh, Hi, Sandra. Uh, yeah. I can hold. (To George) Every time I call I gotta chit-chat with her assistant for, like, twenty minutes. (Back into the phone) Oh, hi, Sandra. Listen, I'm at a pay phone, and there's lots of people here waiting to use it. (Yelling out for believability) I'll be off in a minute! (To Sandra) Yeah, could you just put me through to Elaine? Okay, thanks! (He turns to George) Are you thinking of ideas? (George, picking his teeth with his finger, is absorbed into the television. He seems to not even notice Jerry) Listen, Elaine, is there any way I could get through to you directly? Every time I call Sandra bends my ear for, like, twenty minutes. (Pause) So we're on for later?
Setting: Jerry's apartment|action|Scene cuts to Elaine's office. She's waving a pencil around in her free hand
Setting: Jerry's apartment|ELAINE|Yeah, I'll come by after work. Hey, I got a rubber pencil thing happenin' here.. (Sandra passes her doorway) Uh, I gotta go. I gotta go. (Hangs up) Sandra! Sandra? Hi, can you come here for a second?
Setting: Jerry's apartment|action|Scene goes back to Jerry's apartment
Setting: Jerry's apartment|JERRY|Okay, let's go. (George shuts the television off, ready to work)
Setting: Jerry's apartment|GEORGE|Alright, here we go. You got it?
Setting: Jerry's apartment|JERRY|Yeah.
Setting: Jerry's apartment|GEORGE|Here we go.
Setting: Jerry's apartment|JERRY|Okay, how about this: I'm in my apartment, you come in.
Setting: Jerry's apartment|GEORGE|(Holding out his arms - giving praise) It's beautiful. Now, what do I say?
Setting: Jerry's apartment|action|A long pause, then the scene jumps back to Elaine and Sandra
Setting: Jerry's apartment|ELAINE|Could you do me a favor? Um, when my friends call, could you not talk to them for too long?
Setting: Jerry's apartment|SANDRA|Why? Did Jerry say something?
Setting: Jerry's apartment|ELAINE|No, no.
Setting: Jerry's apartment|SANDRA|He must have said something.
Setting: Jerry's apartment|ELAINE|Oh, no, he didn't say anything.
Setting: Jerry's apartment|SANDRA|(Near tears) I can't work for you! I can't. I'm leaving. (Exits quickly)
Setting: Jerry's apartment|ELAINE|(Calling out to Sandra) No, Sandra. I'm sorry, I'm sorry! I really am! Listen, listen, Jerry's under a lot of pressure right now. It's very hard being a stand-up comedian! Sometimes they don't laugh!
Setting: Jerry's apartment|action|Scene goes back to Jerry's apartment. Jerry and George are sleeping. Kramer slams his apartment door shut, waking both of them up
Setting: Jerry's apartment|GEORGE|Alright, let's go.
Setting: Jerry's apartment|JERRY|Here we go.
Setting: Jerry's apartment|action|Both get situated to write as Kramer enters
Setting: Jerry's apartment|KRAMER|Hey.
Setting: Jerry's apartment|GEORGE|yeah, Kramer, we're, uh, kind of in the middle of something here. We're trying to do a little work..
Setting: Jerry's apartment|JERRY|Yeah, come on. (Kramer gives out a frustrated sigh) What's with you?
Setting: Jerry's apartment|KRAMER|(Complaining) No more golf.
Setting: Jerry's apartment|JERRY|Why?
Setting: Jerry's apartment|KRAMER|Well, you remember I told you about the pro, you know, at the Westchester Country Club, who's letting me play a round every time I give him a couple of those Cuban cigars?
Setting: Jerry's apartment|JERRY|Yeah.
Setting: Jerry's apartment|KRAMER|(Angered) Yeah, well, I lost them all in the fire! (Leaning over the couch, he addresses George) Hey, George, maybe you can ask Susan's father for more, huh?
Setting: Jerry's apartment|GEORGE|What are you, Crazy? I can't ask the guy for more cigars after you burned down his cabin!
Setting: Jerry's apartment|KRAMER|Why? What's one thing got to do with another?
Setting: Jerry's apartment|GEORGE|Kramer, please.
Setting: Jerry's apartment|KRAMER|Well, I can't go back to the public courses, now. I can't! I won't. I mean, you know what that's like? It's crowded, the grass has big brown patches in it, they don't rake the sand traps! Not to mention the caliber of people you have to play with!
Setting: Jerry's apartment|GEORGE|Kramer, I can't help you. You're gonna have to get them some place else.
Setting: Jerry's apartment|KRAMER|(Opening the door) Where? They're Cubans. (Leaves)
Setting: Jerry's apartment|GEORGE|(Getting up) You know what? Maybe I should take off.
Setting: Jerry's apartment|JERRY|What?!
Setting: Jerry's apartment|GEORGE|Well, you know, I gotta go to, uh, Susan's parent's house for dinner.. and, you know, I want to shower first.. and I want to leave myself plenty of time.
Setting: Jerry's apartment|JERRY|(Looking at his watch) You got four hours! What about the script?
Setting: Jerry's apartment|GEORGE|I think we got a bite on it. (Exits)

Setting: The Ross' house|action|George laughs slightly
Setting: The Ross' house|GEORGE|Ohh, I have tremendous respect for people who work with feet. I mean, to dedicate yourself to the foot - you're toiling in virtual anonymity. I mean..
Setting: The Ross' house|action|Seeing the Ross' expression, he trails off
Setting: The Ross' house|GEORGE|Oh, uh, the cigars.. (Chuckles nervously) I'm, uh, suckin' 'em down. I'm puffing my brains out, yeah.
Setting: The Ross' house|GEORGE|(Impersonating Carson) I didn't not know that. Weird. Wild. (Susan and George both laugh)
Setting: The Ross' house|SUSAN|(Explaining) He's doing Johnny Carson, daddy.
Setting: The Ross' house|SUSAN|(To George) Daddy never laughs.
Setting: The Ross' house|GEORGE|Oh, well, so what? Laughter - what is that? I mean, what is the point of opening your mouth and going "Ha, ha!"? What is that? "Ha, ha!"?
Setting: The Ross' house|SUSAN|Daddy, there's, um, there's something that we have to talk to you about..

Setting: Jerry's apartment|ELAINE|(Full of guilt) I know! I screwed up. It's all my fault. Would you call her?
Setting: Jerry's apartment|JERRY|(Caving in) Ohh.. dial the number. (Elaine picks up the phone, and starts to dial) How could you do this?
Setting: Jerry's apartment|ELAINE|(Handing the phone over to him) I was just trying to help you.
Setting: Jerry's apartment|JERRY|(Muttering) Oh, just trying to (Rudely grabs the phone from her) help me.. (Into the phone) Hello? Sandra? Hi, uh, this is Jerry Seinfeld. (Elaine now has her hand in a bowl of popcorn - grabbing a fistful) Listen, I - I just want to tell you, (Jerry sternly grabs Elaine's hand - forcing her to drop the popcorn, then shoves her hand away. Elaine sits back like a scolded child) There's been a terrible misunderstanding: See, I told Elaine that, uh, it was a real treat talking to you on the phone, and she thought I was being sarcastic, you know, 'cause I'm a comedian and all. She thought I meant (Deeply sarcastic) "Yeah, it was a real treat talking to her on the phone." (Back to normal) You know, but I was really being sincere.. No, of course I like you.. Tonight? ..Um, uh, hold on a second. (To Elaine, whispering) Now she wants to have a drink with me. (Elaine mouths out "Just go" while making gestures. Jerry, again, gives in. Back on the phone) Yeah, I think I can.. Um.. yeah, I know where that is.. Ok.. uh, I'll see you there. Okay, bye. (Hangs up, peeved) Now I gotta have a drink with her.

Setting: The Ross' house|SUSAN|Uhh.. about the cabin..
Setting: The Ross' house|GEORGE|(Annoyingly butting in) Kinda like Superman's fortress of solitude.
Setting: The Ross' house|GEORGE|S, uh, Superman - he, uh, built the fortress of solitude up at the North Pole, to, uh, you know, sort of get away from it all..
Setting: The Ross' house|SUSAN|Daddy..
Setting: The Ross' house|SUSAN|Daddy, about the cabin..
Setting: The Ross' house|SUSAN|Well, the thing is..
Setting: The Ross' house|SUSAN|Well, the - the cabin, is, kind of, uh.. George?

Setting: The Ross' house|GEORGE|Burned.
Setting: The Ross' house|GEORGE|(Laughs) yeah, burned. Whoo..
Setting: The Ross' house|SUSAN|(Solemn) No. Nothing.
Setting: The Ross' house|action|Mr. Ross, devastated, slowly gets up and starts walking toward the room's exit as everyone continues to talk
Setting: The Ross' house|GEORGE|Eh, but, you know, Mr. Ross, if - if you look at the whole situating, what with it being your cigars, and everything, it's really rather ironic - one might even say, in a sense, comical.. (Mr. Ross has, by now, left the room. Mrs. Ross is pointing at George, nodding, laughing. As if to say he hit the bullseye. George calls out to Mr. Ross) Really. Think about it.

Setting: Jerry's apartment|SANDRA|(Buttoning her jacket) How could you say something like that to me?!
Setting: Jerry's apartment|JERRY|What? What?! You were the one who was talking dirty. I was just trying to keep up!
Setting: Jerry's apartment|SANDRA|That was a weird thing to say.
Setting: Jerry's apartment|JERRY|Why? It didn't mean anything. I was just trying to join in so you wouldn't feel embarrassed.
Setting: Jerry's apartment|SANDRA|Ohh, I think you're really sick.
Setting: Jerry's apartment|JERRY|(Getting slightly offended) I'm not sick. (Pointing at her) You - you said much sicker things than me.
Setting: Jerry's apartment|SANDRA|I'm leaving. (Moves toward the door. Jerry blocks her path)
Setting: Jerry's apartment|JERRY|I really think you're making too much of this.
Setting: Jerry's apartment|SANDRA|(Attempting to get past him) Excuse me. (They both move to the door)
Setting: Jerry's apartment|JERRY|Let me walk you to a cab.
Setting: Jerry's apartment|SANDRA|(Opens the door) That's ok.

Setting: The Coffee shop|GEORGE|Wo-hoah! What did you do?
Setting: The Coffee shop|JERRY|(Sarcastic) Have you ever told a woman to stop touching your leg?
Setting: The Coffee shop|GEORGE|Yeah, right.
Setting: The Coffee shop|JERRY|I mean, I know it's the wrong thing to do. She works in Elaine's office. I know it's wrong - but I can't get that hand off my leg. I mean, I'm looking at the hand, and I'm thinking, "That hand should not be on my leg." But I can't make my brain to get my mouth to say the words, "Would you mind?!"
Setting: The Coffee shop|GEORGE|Yeah, woman have no problem getting the hand off. How do they do that?
Setting: The Coffee shop|JERRY|I don't know, they're working on a whole other level..
Setting: The Coffee shop|GEORGE|Alright, so, go ahead.
Setting: The Coffee shop|JERRY|So we go back to my apartment..
Setting: The Coffee shop|GEORGE|(Expressing shock) Woah. Whoa! Woah!
Setting: The Coffee shop|JERRY|So, we're, uh, foolin' around there.. you know, it's getting a little passionate.. (Scoots closer to George, to prevent others from hearing) and, uh, she starts with the dirty talking.
Setting: The Coffee shop|GEORGE|(Putting his hands up) Alright, alright, hold on! (Jerry has George's full attention) Time out! Woah, woah! (Scooting in, giddy) What did she say?
Setting: The Coffee shop|JERRY|(Modest) Oh, you know, the usual..
Setting: The Coffee shop|GEORGE|No, I don't know. How do I know the usual?
Setting: The Coffee shop|JERRY|Typical things.
Setting: The Coffee shop|GEORGE|(Picking up the ketchup) What typical? Gimme typical. Gimme some typical.
Setting: The Coffee shop|JERRY|She says, uh.. (Mumbles something inaudible. George, so shocked by what he's just heard, accidentally squeezes the ketchup bottle - ketchup squirts out and files off-screen. George reacts deeply)
Setting: The Coffee shop|GEORGE|(Breathing deeply) That's very dirty. (Jerry nods) That's absolutely filthy.
Setting: The Coffee shop|JERRY|..And then she starts talking about her panties.
Setting: The Coffee shop|GEORGE|(Yelling out to a waitress) Gonna need some water here!
Setting: The Coffee shop|JERRY|So I said something.
Setting: The Coffee shop|GEORGE|Ok, what did you say?
Setting: The Coffee shop|JERRY|(Defensively) Now, bear in mind, I am just trying to keep up.
Setting: The Coffee shop|GEORGE|Of course.
Setting: The Coffee shop|JERRY|Okay? So, she's taking about her panties, so, uh.. So, I said, "You mean the panties your mother laid out for you?"
Setting: The Coffee shop|GEORGE|(Takes a few seconds to mull this one over. Shooting Jerry a confused look, he repeats it) "The panties your mother laid out for you"? (Jerry nods) What does that mean?
Setting: The Coffee shop|JERRY|(Throwing up his hands) I don't know! It just popped out.
Setting: The Coffee shop|GEORGE|Well, how did she react?
Setting: The Coffee shop|JERRY|She flipped out! Just left.
Setting: The Coffee shop|GEORGE|Well, that's not offensive. (Reflects) It's abnormal, but it's not offensive.
Setting: The Coffee shop|JERRY|Look, the main thing is I don't want Elaine to know about any of this. I mean, especially the panty remark. I mean, it's embarrassing. And she's never let me hear the end of it.
Setting: The Coffee shop|JERRY|She will tell her. She's going back to work. I talked her into it - how stupid was that? (Changing subject as they both collect money to pay for the check) Hey, so, Susan's father took that news pretty hard, huh?
Setting: The Coffee shop|GEORGE|Yeah, yeah. He went into the bedroom and started sobbing.
Setting: The Coffee shop|JERRY|I guess he failed to see the humor in it.
Setting: The Coffee shop|GEORGE|Huh. (Makes a "over his head" gesture with his arm) C'mon, let's go, go. We got a lot of work to do today.

Setting: Jerry's apartment|GEORGE|(Scoffs) No, I told you, I'm not gonna do that.
