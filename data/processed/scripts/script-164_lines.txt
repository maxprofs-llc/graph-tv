Setting: Jerry's apartment|NINA|Really?
Setting: Jerry's apartment|JERRY|Believe me. You know, I forgot how much fun it is hanging out with you.
Setting: Jerry's apartment|NINA|I know. You know, we never had a bad conversation.

Setting: FDR's apartment building|KRAMER|Well, why?
Setting: FDR's apartment building|FDR|(Sinister) I have my reasons.

Setting: FDR's apartment building|ELAINE|You're not gonna believe what I got in the mail. Invitation to Sue Ellen Mischke's wedding.
Setting: FDR's apartment building|JERRY|(Joking about the bra-less wonder) Well, at least the wedding gown will give her some support.
Setting: FDR's apartment building|ELAINE|Not the point. The wedding is in one week. I got this (Holds up invitation) today.
Setting: FDR's apartment building|JERRY|So you think it's a non-vite?
Setting: FDR's apartment building|ELAINE|It's an un-vitation! (Notices George is a few inches higher) Hey, are you gettin' taller?
Setting: FDR's apartment building|GEORGE|Timberlands. (Showing Elaine his boots)

Setting: FDR's apartment building|JERRY|Ah, it's probably like Smith over there.
Setting: FDR's apartment building|GEORGE|Jerry, would you make the call already?
Setting: FDR's apartment building|ELAINE|What call?
Setting: FDR's apartment building|JERRY|He wants me to set him up with this girl, Nina Stengal.

Setting: The Coffee shop|GEORGE|So, how come nothing ever happened between you and Nina? (Getting paranoid) Is there a problem with her? Is she a man?
Setting: The Coffee shop|JERRY|Are you?
Setting: The Coffee shop|GEORGE|Well, what's the reason?
Setting: The Coffee shop|JERRY|We were too compatible Our conversations were so engrossing.
Setting: The Coffee shop|GEORGE|How engrossing?
Setting: The Coffee shop|JERRY|If we ever had a problem with Elaine, we could bring in Nina and not lose a step.
Setting: The Coffee shop|GEORGE|Wow! Heh. (Half kidding) You don't, huh, have a replacement lined up for me, do ya? heh he he he he he...
Setting: The Coffee shop|action|Jerry snickers, then stares at George, smiling
Setting: The Coffee shop|JERRY|Anyway, like I was saying, I couldn't make the transition from conversation to sex. There were no awkward pauses... I need an awkward pause.
Setting: The Coffee shop|GEORGE|I'm all for awkward pauses. Fix me up with her.. Wait a minute, Nina just saw me in my Timberlands! Now I have to wear them every time I see her.
Setting: The Coffee shop|JERRY|Why?
Setting: The Coffee shop|GEORGE|In any other shoe, I lose two inches. I - I can't have a drop down. We were eye to eye, I can't go eye to chin!
Setting: The Coffee shop|JERRY|So, you're gonna wear 'em no matter what the situation?
Setting: The Coffee shop|GEORGE|In every situation. No matter how silly I look. (Tastes his Clams Casino) Hm.. tastes a little funky.
