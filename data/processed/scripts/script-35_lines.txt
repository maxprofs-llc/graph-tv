Jerry's Apartment|KEITH|Better bring your gloves, it's freezing out there. It shouldn't take too long. I'd say maybe, oh, four hours. Really though, Jerry, there's not that much. First we got the bedroom, we got two dressers and the bed.
Jerry's Apartment|JERRY|Is there a box spring?
Jerry's Apartment|KEITH|What's that?
Jerry's Apartment|JERRY|Is there a box spring?
Jerry's Apartment|KEITH|Yeah there's a box spring but it's attached to the headboard and we'll have to take that apart. Then we got the couch.
Jerry's Apartment|JERRY|Is that a sectional?
Jerry's Apartment|KEITH|Yeah. Twelve pieces.  …coffee table.
Jerry's Apartment|JERRY|Is that a thick marble?
Jerry's Apartment|KEITH|Three inches thick. Got it in Italy. But the BIG problem is going to be the convertible sofa. You see when you move it it tends to open up so it's going to be real difficult getting it down the stairs.
Jerry's Apartment|JERRY|STAIRS??? There's no elevator?
Jerry's Apartment|KEITH|Nah, it's a brownstone. Three floors.
Jerry's Apartment|JERRY|I'm sorry I can't do this. I can't do it. I can't. It, it's too soon. I don't know you. I can't help you move. I'm sorry. I can't. I just can't.

Jerry's Apartment|KEITH|Hey, I didn't spit at you.
Jerry's Apartment|NEWMAN|Oh, yeah, right.
Jerry's Apartment|KRAMER|No no no, well, then who was it?
Jerry's Apartment|KEITH|Well lookit, the way I remember it (back to the grainy 8mm film parody) I was walking up the ramp. I was upset about the game. That's when you called me pretty boy. It ticked me off. I started to turn around to say something and as I turned around I saw Roger McDowell behind the bushes over by that gravely road. … Anyway he was talking to someone and they were talking to you. I tried to scream out but it was too late. It was already on its way.
Jerry's Apartment|JERRY|I told you!
Jerry's Apartment|NEWMAN|Wow, it was McDowell.
Jerry's Apartment|JERRY|But why? Why McDowell?
Jerry's Apartment|KRAMER|Well, maybe because we were sitting in the right field stands cursing at him in the bullpen all game.
Jerry's Apartment|NEWMAN|He must have caught a glimpse of us when I poured that beer on his head.
Jerry's Apartment|NEWMAN|It was McDowell.
Jerry's Apartment|KRAMER|Oh boy. Uh, look uh, Keith, uh, we're sorry.
Jerry's Apartment|NEWMAN|Yeah, I couldn't be sorrier. I uh.
