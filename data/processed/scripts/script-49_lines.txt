JERRY'S APARTMENT.|JERRY|Ooo, that was a bad toast.
JERRY'S APARTMENT.|GEORGE|It wasn't that bad.
JERRY'S APARTMENT.|JERRY|I never heard anybody curse in a toast.
JERRY'S APARTMENT.|GEORGE|I was trying to loosen 'em up a little bit.
JERRY'S APARTMENT.|JERRY|There were old people there, all the relatives. You were like a Red Fox record. I mean, at the end of the toast nobody even drank. They were just standing there, they were just frozen! That might have been one of the worst all time toasts.
JERRY'S APARTMENT.|GEORGE|Alright, still her father didn't have to throw me out like that, he could have just asked me to leave. The guy had me in a headlock! Susan's not going tonight you know.

OUTSIDE THE THEATRE|JERRY|That is one angry clown!
Middle Monologue|JERRY|The hardest part about being a clown, it seems to me, would be that you're constantly referred to as a clown. "Who was that clown?", "I'm not working with that clown, did you hire that clown?", "The guy's a clown!". How do you even start into being a clown, how do you know that you want to be a clown, I guess you get to a point where you're pants look so bad, it's actually easier to become a clown than having the proper alterations done. Because if you think about it, a clown, if there isn't a circus around them, is really just a very annoying person. You're in the back seat of this guys Volkswagen, "What, you're picking somebody else up? Oh man!"

Closing Monologue|JERRY|I had some friends drag me to an opera recently, you know how they've got those little opera glasses, you know, do you really need binoculars, I mean how big do these people have to get before you can spot 'em. These opera kids they're going two-fifty, two-eighty, three-twenty-five, they're wearing big white woolly vests, the women have like the breastplates, the bullet hats with the horn coming out. If you can't pick these people out, forget opera, think about optometry, maybe that?s more you're thing.
