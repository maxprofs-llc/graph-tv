Peterman's Office|PETERMAN|Now, down to business. (thoughtful) I have had this vision of a diaphanous rum-runner scarf.
Peterman's Office|action|The employees take notes.
Peterman's Office|ELAINE|Well, we could fly some fabric in from our silk factories, for about a thousand dollars a bolt.
Peterman's Office|MORTY|(shocked) A thousand?! I know a coupla Chinamen over there on Forty-third Street, who'll do it for half that.
Peterman's Office|ELAINE|(tactful) It's, ah, Asian-Americans.
Peterman's Office|MORTY|What?
Peterman's Office|PETERMAN|(puzzled) Who are you?
Peterman's Office|ELAINE|Don't worry, I...
Peterman's Office|MORTY|Morty Seinfeld. I cut velvet for forty years with Harry Altman.
Peterman's Office|ELAINE|Okay, Mr Seinfeld, this is not the t...
Peterman's Office|PETERMAN|Elaine, did you hire this man?
Peterman's Office|ELAINE|(worried) No, no. Well, I mean, you know, he's more like an intern, you know, at best.
Monk's|action|George and Elaine sit in a booth.
Monk's|ELAINE|So, if your parents move to Florida, you're poor.
Monk's|GEORGE|(pointing out the positive) But happy.
Monk's|ELAINE|Obviously. And if they stay, you're rich, but...
Monk's|action|Elaine gestures with her hand.
Monk's|GEORGE|Obviously.
Monk's|ELAINE|Quite a dilemma. You know, I have a bit of a dilemma of my own.
Monk's|GEORGE|No, no. No, no, no. (determined) We're staying on me. We haven't solved anything yet.
Monk's|ELAINE|Alright, this is easy. Let 'em go.
Monk's|GEORGE|What d'you mean, let 'em go? They're spending all my money.
Monk's|ELAINE|Alright, well, then they stay. Lemma ask you something...
Monk's|GEORGE|(upset) Could you put a little thought into this? Jerry's gone, you could humour me. He humours me.
Monk's|ELAINE|Speaking of Jerry, his father is driving me so crazy down at Peterman's.
Monk's|GEORGE|You know what I do at the Yankees, when one of these old guys is breathing down my neck?
Monk's|ELAINE|What?
Monk's|GEORGE|You schedule a late meeting.
Monk's|ELAINE|(puzzlement) Huh? What does that do?
Monk's|GEORGE|These old guys, they're up at 4 a.m., by two thirty they're wiped. (animated) How did we get back onto you?!
Monk's|ELAINE|(grabbing her bag and coat) I gotta split.
Monk's|action|Elaine gets up and leaves.
Monk's|GEORGE|(shouted after Elaine) You know, I got nothing outta this!

The Costanza Home, Queens|FRANK|That's right. That's me on the left.
The Costanza Home, Queens|KRAMER|So, you sleep in separate beds.
The Costanza Home, Queens|FRANK|Thirty years ago, we came to an agreement. It was the only way I could get some rest.
The Costanza Home, Queens|KRAMER|(intrigued) Really?
The Costanza Home, Queens|FRANK|(confidential) Estelle's got the (jerks his elbow) jimmy arms.

Klompus Home, Del Boca Vista|action|A grubby Jerry sits at the table, with Jack hovering over him.
Klompus Home, Del Boca Vista|JACK|Jerry, it's getting late. You've cleaned up the car. You've made all your phone calls. Why are you still here?
Klompus Home, Del Boca Vista|JERRY|Well, I uh, maxed out my credit cards, and I don't have enough cash for a hotel room. So...
Klompus Home, Del Boca Vista|JACK|You are uh, thinking of staying here?
Klompus Home, Del Boca Vista|JERRY|Well...
Klompus Home, Del Boca Vista|JACK|(laughing) You've got some nerve. I almost break my neck in that death-trap of yours, and now you ask me for a favour!
Klompus Home, Del Boca Vista|JERRY|You didn't like that crack about the pen.
Klompus Home, Del Boca Vista|JACK|I did not.
The Costanza Home, Queens|action|George and his parents sit at the kitchen table, while Kramer does some washing up in the sink.
The Costanza Home, Queens|GEORGE|Well, I've given this a lot of thought, and I've gotta say...
The Costanza Home, Queens|action|George is distracted momentarily by Kramer clattering dishes. He gives Kramer a look and continues.
The Costanza Home, Queens|GEORGE|(attempting sincerity) As much as I'd like to see the two of you living it up in a warm, tropical, setting, I, I would just miss you too much. (smiling) So, I've decided, I want you to stay.
The Costanza Home, Queens|FRANK|It's too late. We bought a condo at Del Boca Vista. We're leaving tonight.
The Costanza Home, Queens|action|Estelle and Frank smile at each other.
The Costanza Home, Queens|GEORGE|(crestfallen) But you said it was my call.
The Costanza Home, Queens|ESTELLE|We were just being nice.
The Costanza Home, Queens|action|George looks crushed.
The Costanza Home, Queens|ESTELLE|(motherly concern) Cosmo, are you sure you're gonna be alright here alone?
The Costanza Home, Queens|KRAMER|Oh, yeah, yeah. I got Emily coming over tonight.
The Costanza Home, Queens|GEORGE|(animated) You're letting him have a woman over?!
The Costanza Home, Queens|FRANK|He's not family. It's different, psychologically.
The Costanza Home, Queens|action|Kramer is examining the label on a wine bottle, as George turns to look at him. He gives George a little smile.
Peterman's Office|action|The employees, including Elaine and Morty, sit round Peterman's desk as he waxes lyrical about his adventures. Morty looks impatient, glancing at his watch as Peterman speaks.
Peterman's Office|PETERMAN|And so, I made an explosive out of chick peas, and I stopped that great rhino right in his tracks.
Peterman's Office|MORTY|Well, it's getting kinda late, why don't we uh...
Peterman's Office|ELAINE|Mr Peterman, that can't have been the only time that you faced mortal danger.
Peterman's Office|PETERMAN|(smiles and laughs) Ha ha ha. Funny you should ask, Elaine.
Peterman's Office|MORTY|Look, if we're gonna stay here until all hours of the night, can we at least get some food here?
Peterman's Office|PETERMAN|(looks at his watch) It's only five fifteen. So, later on that same day, I developed a great hankering for some wild honey...
Peterman's Office|MORTY|(standing) Okay, I'm done. I'll be back in the morning, when he's close to finish with his story.
Peterman's Office|action|Morty heads for the door. Peterman's voice brings him to a halt.
Peterman's Office|PETERMAN|Morty. My stories are what sell these clothes.
Peterman's Office|MORTY|Cheap fabric, and dim lighting. That's how you move merchandise.
Peterman's Office|PETERMAN|(winks) Morty, you're out.
Peterman's Office|MORTY|(unconcerned) Ach, I never knew what the hell I was peddling with those stupid cartoons and that paper book, anyway.
Peterman's Office|action|Morty walks out, leaving a not entirely unhappy Elaine behind.

Street, Del Boca Vista|action|Frank walks along the sidewalk, past a familiar looking Cadillac. Something catches his eye, and he looks into the car. A figure is asleep on the back seat with his face covered. Frank 'gives a what is the world coming to' look and throws up his hands as he walks away.

The Costanza Home, Queens|action|Kramer stands in the doorway of the bathroom, while Emily sits on Estelle's bed, reading a paperback.
The Costanza Home, Queens|KRAMER|I don't know why I let you talk me into that corned beef at Snitzer's.
The Costanza Home, Queens|EMILY|(not looking up from her book) No-one held a gun to your head.
The Costanza Home, Queens|KRAMER|(dismissive) Yeah.
The Costanza Home, Queens|EMILY|(still reading) Don't forget, we're eating dinner at the Feinerman's tomorrow night.
The Costanza Home, Queens|KRAMER|(moody) Oh, why do I have to go? They're your friends.
The Costanza Home, Queens|EMILY|You like 'em.
The Costanza Home, Queens|KRAMER|I've had it with 'em.
The Costanza Home, Queens|action|Kramer disappears into the bathroom.
The Costanza Home, Queens|EMILY|Then we won't go.
The Costanza Home, Queens|action|Kramer reemerges with a glass of water.
The Costanza Home, Queens|KRAMER|(yielding) Okay, okay. What time?
The Costanza Home, Queens|EMILY|Eight thirty.
The Costanza Home, Queens|action|Kramer downs the glass of water in one go, and then belches.
The Costanza Home, Queens|KRAMER|(satisfied) Ahh. That was alright.
The Costanza Home, Queens|action|Emily smiles at him, then returns to her book.
Monk's|action|Jerry, George and Elaine sit in a booth. Jerry drinking coffee, George eating and Elaine reading from the pages of a newspaper.
Monk's|ELAINE|'One bright note in today's market, was the stock of retailer J Peterman, whose founder's surprise return generated a rise of twelve and a half points.'
Monk's|action|Elaine folds the paper and drops it on the table.
Monk's|JERRY|Mmm-mmm-mmm. That means, if you still had those stock options...
Monk's|ELAINE|(downcast) Yeah.
Monk's|GEORGE|(Jerry-style) That's a shame.
Monk's|ELAINE|(sharp) What, are you sticking it to me?
Monk's|GEORGE|(innocent) What?
Monk's|ELAINE|I think you're sticking it to me.
Monk's|JERRY|Elaine, I'm sure George is just being sympathetic.
Monk's|ELAINE|(leaning forward and accusing) Stickin' it!
Monk's|action|George doesn't meet Elaine's stare.
Monk's|JERRY|You're not alone. I'm practically broke.
Monk's|ELAINE|Really?
Monk's|JERRY|No. But, I did blow over twenty thousand on that Cadillac.
Monk's|action|George takes another forkful of what's on his plate.
Monk's|GEORGE|(relishing) Hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm. Delicious.
Monk's|JERRY|Well, you seem happy.
Monk's|GEORGE|I am. The folks are twelve hundred miles away. (gleeful) I'm basking in the buffer zone. (looks for the waitress) 'Nother piece of pie here!
Monk's|ELAINE|So, were your parents shocked to see the Cadillac?
Monk's|JERRY|Actually, I haven't heard from 'em yet.
Monk's|ELAINE|Hmm.
Florida|action|Morty and Helen sit on a couch, reading magazines.
Florida|MORTY|When are we gonna tell Jerry?
Florida|HELEN|I don't wanna worry him. We'll tell him next time we go up.
Florida|MORTY|He thought he could buy back that Cadillac for us? He's not getting away with that.
Florida|action|It's revealed that the Seinfelds are in a trailer parked behind the Cadillac.
Florida|HELEN|Besides, that condo was too much house.
The Costanza Home, Del Boca Vista|action|Estelle is sitting on the couch in the condo, while Frank peers out of the window.
The Costanza Home, Del Boca Vista|ESTELLE|How many times can you check the car?
The Costanza Home, Del Boca Vista|FRANK|(coming away from the window) I saw a bum sleeping in a Cadillac the other day.
The Costanza Home, Del Boca Vista|action|Frank sits in a chair.
The Costanza Home, Del Boca Vista|ESTELLE|Why would someone break into a car to take a nap?
The Costanza Home, Del Boca Vista|FRANK|They don't nap. They make it their home. They urinate in there!
The Costanza Home, Del Boca Vista|ESTELLE|(shouts) You're driving me crazy!
The Costanza Home, Del Boca Vista|FRANK|(standing) That's it, we're going back to Queens. (claps hands) Where's my hat?
The Costanza Home, Del Boca Vista|action|Frank walks out of the room.
The Costanza Home, Del Boca Vista|ESTELLE|(shouts) Nooh!
