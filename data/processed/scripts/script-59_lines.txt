Opening scene|action|Sidra on a Stairmaster at the New York Health Club. Jerry enters after his workout w/gymbag in hand.
Opening scene|SIDRA|Oh, hi Jerry.
Opening scene|JERRY|Hi, Sidra. I usually last about ten minutes on a Stairmaster. Unless of course there's someone stretching in front of me in a leotard, then I can go an hour.
Opening scene|JERRY|Oh, yeah. That's why they call it a Stairmaster. You get up there and you stare.
Opening scene|JERRY|Alright, I'll see you Thursday night, right?
Opening scene|SIDRA|Thursday night.
Opening scene|JERRY|Alright.
Opening scene|action|Elaine walks over to Jerry.
Opening scene|ELAINE|Good workout?
Opening scene|ELAINE|That's a pretty girl.
Opening scene|JERRY|Tremendous girl.
Opening scene|ELAINE|She's the one you went out with last night?
Opening scene|JERRY|Yeah. I really like her.
Opening scene|ELAINE|You know, uh...they're fake.
Opening scene|JERRY|What? Don't say that!
Opening scene|ELAINE|Nah! They're fake!
Opening scene|JERRY|How do you know?
Opening scene|ELAINE|I can tell. You know how you're always bragging how you can spot a lesbian?
Opening scene|JERRY|I'm not bragging, I happen to have a very keen lesbian eye. (A woman walks by Jerry and Elaine.) Hi, how ya doin.' (Jerry jerks a thumb at the woman to confirm his talent. Elaine is skeptical.)
Opening scene|ELAINE|Oh, right. C'mon, don't you think they seem a bit too perfect?
Opening scene|JERRY|Yes, they do!
Opening scene|ELAINE|I never knew you were so into breasts. I thought you were a leg man.
Opening scene|JERRY|A leg man? Why would I be a leg man? I don't need legs. I have legs. Have you ever seen her naked in the locker room?
Opening scene|ELAINE|No.
Opening scene|JERRY|Oh, well, then I can't accept your testimony. Maybe if you had seen her naked.
Opening scene|ELAINE|I don't want to see her naked.
Opening scene|JERRY|Well, I do.
Opening scene|ELAINE|Well, that's your problem.
Opening scene|JERRY|Look, you made the allegation. The least you could do is follow up.
Opening scene|ELAINE|Jerry, what am I gonna do? I'm gonna go in there and spy on her in the sauna?
Opening scene|JERRY|Yes! Go in there! Do a little investigative journalism. I need to know!
Opening scene|ELAINE|But a few more dates and you can find out for yourself!
Opening scene|JERRY|Don't be so sure. Look at George - he's on his ninth date with Betsy, he still hasn't gotten anywhere with her.
Opening scene|ELAINE|What's his problem?
Opening scene|JERRY|Well, every time he tries to make a move, something screws up. Like on their last date, they were on the couch, but she was sitting on his wrong side.
Opening scene|ELAINE|Wrong side?
Opening scene|JERRY|Yeah, she was on his right side. He can't make a move with his left hand. Can't go left.
Opening scene|ELAINE|He can't go left.
Opening scene|JERRY|No! I'm lefty, can't go right. What about women? Do they go left or right?
Opening scene|ELAINE|Nah, we just play defense.
New scene - George and Betsy at Betsy's apartment. George tries to make it to the right-hand side of the couch, but Betsy beats him to it.|GEORGE|Can I ask you a question? Would you mind switching seats?
New scene - George and Betsy at Betsy's apartment. George tries to make it to the right-hand side of the couch, but Betsy beats him to it.|BETSY|Oh, actually, I really prefer to sit here. I don't hear very well out of this ear (points to her right ear) so, I always try to sit to the right of people.
New scene - George and Betsy at Betsy's apartment. George tries to make it to the right-hand side of the couch, but Betsy beats him to it.|GEORGE|I'll shout.
New scene - George and Betsy at Betsy's apartment. George tries to make it to the right-hand side of the couch, but Betsy beats him to it.|BETSY|Well, I really think I feel more comfortable here.
New scene - George and Betsy at Betsy's apartment. George tries to make it to the right-hand side of the couch, but Betsy beats him to it.|GEORGE|C'mon, c'mon...(stands up and physically rolls Betsy to the left side of the couch.) See, now, is that so bad?
New scene - George and Betsy at Betsy's apartment. George tries to make it to the right-hand side of the couch, but Betsy beats him to it.|BETSY|What? (The phone rings.)
New scene - George and Betsy at Betsy's apartment. George tries to make it to the right-hand side of the couch, but Betsy beats him to it.|BETSY|No, no, it's not on...
New scene - George and Betsy at Betsy's apartment. George tries to make it to the right-hand side of the couch, but Betsy beats him to it.|GEORGE|They'll call back.
New scene - George and Betsy at Betsy's apartment. George tries to make it to the right-hand side of the couch, but Betsy beats him to it.|BETSY|But George, what if it's an emergency?
New scene - George and Betsy at Betsy's apartment. George tries to make it to the right-hand side of the couch, but Betsy beats him to it.|GEORGE|In the whole world right now, there's maybe three emergencies. Why would you think, on this entire planet, that you're one of those three?
New scene - George and Betsy at Betsy's apartment. George tries to make it to the right-hand side of the couch, but Betsy beats him to it.|BETSY|George, please. (Gets up and answers the phone.) Hello? What? (shocked) Oh my god!
New scene - George and Betsy at Betsy's apartment. George tries to make it to the right-hand side of the couch, but Betsy beats him to it.|GEORGE|Alright, maybe four.
Cut back to George and Betsy at her apartment. Betsy's still on the phone.|BETSY|So, when's the funeral? Well, Aunt Clarice was so ill, I guess it was really a blessing. (George, on the couch behind Betsy, is impatiently waiting for her to get off the phone so he can continue putting the moves on her. He shrugs, and crosses himself.) Yeah, I'll fly home as soon as I can. (George waves goodbye, and mimics a plane flying through the air with his hand.) O.k. You, too. Get some sleep. (Betsy looks at George, and he manufactures a completely phony look of sorrow.)
New scene - Jerry and Elaine in Jerry's apartment.|JERRY|You're sure?
New scene - Jerry and Elaine in Jerry's apartment.|ELAINE|Positive! This chick's playin' with confederate money.
New scene - Jerry and Elaine in Jerry's apartment.|JERRY|Well then, that's it. That's the end of that.
New scene - Jerry and Elaine in Jerry's apartment.|ELAINE|What? Just 'cause of that?
New scene - Jerry and Elaine in Jerry's apartment.|JERRY|Just 'cause of that? It's like finding out Mickey Mantle corked his bat!
New scene - Jerry and Elaine in Jerry's apartment.|ELAINE|Oh, come on! You've dated women with nosejobs, what's the difference?
New scene - Jerry and Elaine in Jerry's apartment.|JERRY|You don't touch the nose! You don't aspire to reach the nose. You don't unhook anything to get to a nose, and no man has ever tried to look up a woman's nostril.
New scene - Jerry and Elaine in Jerry's apartment.|ELAINE|You've put a lot of thought into this, haven't you?
New scene - Jerry and Elaine in Jerry's apartment.|JERRY|Well, I take it very seriously.
New scene - Jerry and Elaine in Jerry's apartment.|ELAINE|You know, sometimes when I think you're the shallowest man I've ever met, you somehow manage to drain a little more out of the pool.
New scene - Jerry and Elaine in Jerry's apartment.|action|Kramer enters.
New scene - Jerry and Elaine in Jerry's apartment.|KRAMER|Hey.
New scene - Jerry and Elaine in Jerry's apartment.|JERRY|Hey. You know, I do kinda wonder what fake breast feel like.
New scene - Jerry and Elaine in Jerry's apartment.|KRAMER|Well, I know what they feel like.
New scene - Jerry and Elaine in Jerry's apartment.|JERRY|You? How do you know?
New scene - Jerry and Elaine in Jerry's apartment.|KRAMER|Well, I lived in Los Angeles for three months.
New scene - Jerry and Elaine in Jerry's apartment.|KRAMER|I do! I just miss the warm weather, y'know? Jeez. Oh man, I wish I could get away.
New scene - Jerry and Elaine in Jerry's apartment.|JERRY|Real busy now down at the office?
New scene - Jerry and Elaine in Jerry's apartment.|KRAMER|No. Huh? You know who I saw at the health club? Salman Rushdie.
New scene - Jerry, George and Kramer in the sauna at the health club.|GEORGE|I know what the problem is - I like her too much. That's why I can't make a move.
New scene - Jerry, George and Kramer in the sauna at the health club.|JERRY|You put her on a pedestal.
New scene - Jerry, George and Kramer in the sauna at the health club.|KRAMER|I put them on a dental chair.
New scene - Jerry, George and Kramer in the sauna at the health club.|JERRY|He puts 'em on a dental chair.
New scene - Jerry, George and Kramer in the sauna at the health club.|GEORGE|I'm not her boyfriend. I want to be her boyfriend.
New scene - Jerry, George and Kramer in the sauna at the health club.|KRAMER|Whoo. It's like a sauna in here.
New scene - Jerry, George and Kramer in the sauna at the health club.|GEORGE|That's funny. You're a funny guy.
New scene - Jerry, George and Kramer in the sauna at the health club.|JERRY|Yeah, funny. Yeah, I never heard that before. (To George) So, you goin' to the funeral?
New scene - Jerry, George and Kramer in the sauna at the health club.|GEORGE|Why, you think I should?
New scene - Jerry, George and Kramer in the sauna at the health club.|JERRY|What, are you kidding? It's a golden opportunity to advance the relationship. She's crying, you put your arm around her and console her...you're the consolation guy!
New scene - Jerry, George and Kramer in the sauna at the health club.|GEORGE|I'm the consolation guy...?
New scene - Jerry, George and Kramer in the sauna at the health club.|KRAMER|Consolation Guy is big.
New scene - Jerry, George and Kramer in the sauna at the health club.|JERRY|Her aunt dying is the best thing that ever happened to you.
New scene - Jerry, George and Kramer in the sauna at the health club.|KRAMER|It's like ten dates in one shot.
New scene - Jerry, George and Kramer in the sauna at the health club.|JERRY|This confers upon you instant boyfriend status. The family's there...you're taking care of things...you're gettin' the sandwiches...you're the rock!
New scene - Jerry, George and Kramer in the sauna at the health club.|GEORGE|It's in Detroit though, it's an expensive flight.
New scene - Jerry, George and Kramer in the sauna at the health club.|KRAMER|Why don't you get a "death in the family" fare?
New scene - Jerry, George and Kramer in the sauna at the health club.|GEORGE|What?
New scene - Jerry, George and Kramer in the sauna at the health club.|KRAMER|You go to the airlines, you tell them you got a death in the family? They give you 50% off the fare.
New scene - Jerry, George and Kramer in the sauna at the health club.|GEORGE|Really?
New scene - Jerry, George and Kramer in the sauna at the health club.|KRAMER|In fact, listen...I'll go down there with ya. You know, we'll tell them there's a death in my family, you buy the ticket, I'll split it...then I'll get the bonus miles and you'll get to Detroit for a quarter of the price!
New scene - Jerry, George and Kramer in the sauna at the health club.|action|George considers.
New scene - Elaine in the sauna again. We hear her thoughts.|action|Sidra enters the sauna with a friend.
New scene - Elaine in the sauna again. We hear her thoughts.|ELAINE|Uh...sorry, I couldn't help overhearing.
New scene - Elaine in the sauna again. We hear her thoughts.|SIDRA|Oh, that's o.k.
New scene - Elaine in the sauna again. We hear her thoughts.|ELAINE|Did he give you a reason?
New scene - Elaine in the sauna again. We hear her thoughts.|SIDRA|Yeah. He's going back to his old girlfriend.
New scene - Elaine in the sauna again. We hear her thoughts.|ELAINE|Really?
New scene - Elaine in the sauna again. We hear her thoughts.|SIDRA|He said she's mentally ill. He's one of those guys who is obsessed with neatness and order? Everything has gotta be just so. He would have made a great Nazi.
New scene - Elaine in the sauna again. We hear her thoughts.|ELAINE|Hey, does he ever talk about Superman?
New scene - Elaine in the sauna again. We hear her thoughts.|SIDRA|Yes! How did you know?
New scene - Elaine in the sauna again. We hear her thoughts.|ELAINE|Oh, I know the type.
New scene - Elaine in the sauna again. We hear her thoughts.|SIDRA|So you can relate?
New scene - Elaine in the sauna again. We hear her thoughts.|ELAINE|Oh, yeah.
New scene - Elaine in the sauna again. We hear her thoughts.|ELAINE|Oh, hi. I'm Elaine. (Gets up to shake Sidra's hand, but stumbles and falls "right into them.")
New scene - Jerry and Elaine in Jerry's apartment.|ELAINE|So anyway, I stood up to shake her hand, then suddenly I lost my balance and I fell right into her.
New scene - Jerry and Elaine in Jerry's apartment.|JERRY|You fell on her?
New scene - Jerry and Elaine in Jerry's apartment.|ELAINE|I touched 'em.
New scene - Jerry and Elaine in Jerry's apartment.|JERRY|You what?
New scene - Jerry and Elaine in Jerry's apartment.|ELAINE|I...touched...'em.
New scene - Jerry and Elaine in Jerry's apartment.|JERRY|You touched 'em?!
New scene - Jerry and Elaine in Jerry's apartment.|ELAINE|I needed them to help me break my fall! If it hadn't been for them, I could have really injured myself!
New scene - Jerry and Elaine in Jerry's apartment.|JERRY|Wow.
New scene - Jerry and Elaine in Jerry's apartment.|ELAINE|Anyway...they're real.
New scene - Jerry and Elaine in Jerry's apartment.|JERRY|Excuse me?!
New scene - Jerry and Elaine in Jerry's apartment.|ELAINE|I think they might be real.
New scene - Jerry and Elaine in Jerry's apartment.|JERRY|Oh, what do you know, you have no breast touching experience.
New scene - Jerry and Elaine in Jerry's apartment.|ELAINE|I've touched mine!
New scene - Jerry and Elaine in Jerry's apartment.|JERRY|So have I.
New scene - Jerry and Elaine in Jerry's apartment.|ELAINE|Oh, right...I forgot. (smiles)
New scene - Jerry and Elaine in Jerry's apartment.|JERRY|Anyway, touching two breasts doesn't make you an expert.
New scene - Jerry and Elaine in Jerry's apartment.|ELAINE|Alright, well anyway, I think they're real. And if they are, I must say they are...spectacular.
New scene - Jerry and Elaine in Jerry's apartment.|JERRY|Aw, what are you doin' to me? (puts his head down on the counter.)
New scene - George and Kramer at the airline ticket counter. Kramer is pretending to be grief-stricken.|KRAMER|I saw her last week, she looked healthy and peaceful, but...she knew...

New scene - George and Kramer at the airline ticket counter. Kramer is pretending to be grief-stricken.|GEORGE|You don't think you can buy the ticket yourself...? No, there, there...you sit, and I'll purchase the ticket for you.
New scene - George and Kramer at the airline ticket counter. Kramer is pretending to be grief-stricken.|CLERK|You're a good friend.
New scene - George and Kramer at the airline ticket counter. Kramer is pretending to be grief-stricken.|GEORGE|I understand you offer a 50%-off 'bereavement' fare...?
New scene - George and Kramer at the airline ticket counter. Kramer is pretending to be grief-stricken.|CLERK|Yes, all you have to do is pay the full fare now, then return to any one of our counters with a copy of the death certificate, and we'll refund half your fare.
New scene - George and Kramer at the airline ticket counter. Kramer is pretending to be grief-stricken.|GEORGE|The death certificate?
New scene - George and Kramer at the airline ticket counter. Kramer is pretending to be grief-stricken.|CLERK|Yes, yes, we do need documentation or you know, people could take advantage.
New scene - George and Kramer at the airline ticket counter. Kramer is pretending to be grief-stricken.|GEORGE|What kind of a sick person would do a thing like that?
New scene - George and Kramer at the airline ticket counter. Kramer is pretending to be grief-stricken.|CLERK|I know! But it happens.
New scene - George and Kramer at the airline ticket counter. Kramer is pretending to be grief-stricken.|GEORGE|You want my friend to ask his uncle, a man who just lost his wife of 44 years, for a death certificate so that he can save a few bucks on a flight?
New scene - George and Kramer at the airline ticket counter. Kramer is pretending to be grief-stricken.|CLERK|That would be $387 round-trip.
New scene - George and Kramer at the airline ticket counter. Kramer is pretending to be grief-stricken.|CLERK|Yes.

Cut back to Jerry and Elaine in Jerry's apartment.|ELAINE|Hey, of the two of us, I'm the only one who's touched 'em.
Cut back to Jerry and Elaine in Jerry's apartment.|JERRY|But you were just grabbing on to them to save your life. If you were drowning and I threw you a life preserver, you think you could tell me if it was an inflatable?
Cut back to Jerry and Elaine in Jerry's apartment.|ELAINE|I wouldn't have said anything if I knew you were going to stop seeing her!
Cut back to Jerry and Elaine in Jerry's apartment.|JERRY|Well, I don't mind someone with a phony personality, but I gotta draw the line somewhere.

New scene - Jerry and Kramer entering Jerry's apartment after returning from the health club.|KRAMER|Jerry, are you blind? He's a writer. He said his name was Sal Bass. Bass, Jerry! Instead of salmon, he went with bass! He just substituted one fish for another!
New scene - Jerry and Kramer entering Jerry's apartment after returning from the health club.|JERRY|Look, you idiot, first of all, it's Salman, not salmon!
New scene - Jerry and Kramer entering Jerry's apartment after returning from the health club.|KRAMER|Jerry, Jerry, you're missing the big picture!

Cut back to George at the wake in Detroit.|GEORGE|So...?
Cut back to George at the wake in Detroit.|TIMMY|That's like putting your whole mouth right in the dip! From now on, when you take a chip - just take one dip and end it!
Cut back to George at the wake in Detroit.|GEORGE|Well, I'm sorry, Timmy...but I don't dip that way. (takes a chip.)
Cut back to George at the wake in Detroit.|TIMMY|Oh, you don't, huh?
