Setting: A car dealership|JERRY|Yeah, right. And what about the floating cities?
Setting: A car dealership|GEORGE|And the underwater bubble cities?

Setting: A car dealership|JERRY|All right. Calm down.
Setting: A car dealership|GEORGE|My father had a car salesman buddy. He was gonna fix him up real nice. Next thing I know, I’m gettin’ dropped of in a Le Car with a fabric sunroof. All the kids are shoutin’ at me, "Hey, Le George! Bonjour, Le George! Let’s stuff Le George in Le Locker!"
