Setting: Night club|JERRY|You know, I tell ya, I gotta say that I'm enjoying adulthood. For a lot of reasons. And, I'll tell you reason number one: as an adult, if I want a cookie, I have a cookie, okay? I have three cookies or four cookies, or eleven cookies if I want. Many times I will intentionally ruin my entire appetite. Just ruin it. And then, I call my mother up right after to tell her that I did it. "Hello, Mom? yeah, I just ruined my entire appetite.. cookies." So what if you ruin.. See, because as an adult, we understand even if you ruin an appetite, there's another appetite coming right behind it. There's no danger in running out of appetites. I've got millions of them, I'll ruin them whenever I want!

Setting: Coffee shop|ELAINE|Hey, where's Kramer?
Setting: Coffee shop|JERRY|I don't know. That's like asking "Where's Waldo?"
Setting: Coffee shop|GEORGE|(Still holding the note) I think I'm having a heart attack.
Setting: Coffee shop|JERRY|I don't think that's it.
Setting: Coffee shop|GEORGE|I'm not kidding.
Setting: Coffee shop|JERRY|What does that mean?
Setting: Coffee shop|ELAINE|I think what he's trying to say is that he's having a heart attack.
Setting: Coffee shop|JERRY|Oh, he's having a heart attack.
Setting: Coffee shop|GEORGE|Tightness..

Setting: Coffee shop|GEORGE|Shortness of breath..

Setting: Hospital room|JERRY|"Salami salami bologna"?
Setting: Hospital room|DOCTOR|(In a hurry) Oh, your friend's fine. He didn't have a heart attack. I'll be in - in a few minutes.
Setting: Hospital room|JERRY|(Sarcastic) What a surprise. (Enters George's room overly sympathetic - leading George to think that the Doctor told Jerry something significant) Hey, how ya doin' buddy? You need anything? Do you want me to go out and get you a Superman comic?
Setting: Hospital room|GEORGE|No, no thanks.
Setting: Hospital room|JERRY|(Still going along with the practical joke) You know, I was wondering.. You know that Black Hawks jacket you have?
Setting: Hospital room|GEORGE|Oh, sure, my Black Hawks jacket. I love my Black Hawks jacket.
Setting: Hospital room|JERRY|Well, you know, I was thinking - if things don't exactly work out..
Setting: Hospital room|GEORGE|Well, it wouldn't fit you. The sleeves are too short.
Setting: Hospital room|JERRY|No, I tried it on. It fits good.
Setting: Hospital room|GEORGE|Well, I didn't really think about what I was gonna do with all..
Setting: Hospital room|JERRY|Well, you know..
Setting: Hospital room|GEORGE|(Reluctantly) Well, okay.
Setting: Hospital room|JERRY|Oh, and.. do you think it would be alright if I called Susan Davis?
Setting: Hospital room|GEORGE|Susan Davis? (Getting possessive) Hey, wait a second..
Setting: Hospital room|JERRY|Well, it's not like we'd be bumping into you.
Setting: Hospital room|GEORGE|I don't know.. you and Susan Davis?
Setting: Hospital room|JERRY|You know, if your future was a little more certain..
Setting: Hospital room|GEORGE|Okay, go ahead. Call her, get married, have babies, have a great life.. What do I care? I'm finished. (Really depressed) It's all over for me. In fact, let's end it right now. Jerry, kill me, kill me now. I'm begging you. Let's just get it over with. Be a pal.. Just take the pillow and put it over my face.
Setting: Hospital room|JERRY|Well, ah.. (Takes his pillow) What? Kind of like this? (Violently smothers George with the pillow. George freaks out. He didn't think Jerry would actually do it)

Setting: Hospital room|JERRY|(Whispering) There's nothing wrong with him. I saw the doctor. He's fine.

Setting: Hospital room|ELAINE|Hi, George. How ya feeling? Is anybody getting your apartment?
Setting: Hospital room|action|Jerry and Elaine both sit down, and have their own conversation. They completely ignore George
Setting: Hospital room|GEORGE|I'll tell ya, if I ever get out of here, I'm gonna change my life. I'm gonna do a whole Zen thing. Take up yoga, meditate.. I'll eat right. Calm down, lose my anger.. (Sees Jerry and Elaine aren't listening. He snaps) Hey, is anybody listening?!
Setting: Hospital room|action|The doctor enters. Elaine and the doctor exchange an awkward, romantic glance
Setting: Hospital room|DOCTOR|(To Elaine) Uh, hello. (To George) Uh, Mr. Costanza?
Setting: Hospital room|GEORGE|(Panicky) Uh, yeah. You know, Doctor, I gotta tell you, I feel a lot better.
Setting: Hospital room|DOCTOR|Well, we looked at your EKG's, ran some tests, did a complete work-up.
Setting: Hospital room|GEORGE|(Getting in a more panicked state) Oh God, Mommy!
Setting: Hospital room|DOCTOR|And you simply haven't had a heart attack.
Setting: Hospital room|GEORGE|(Relieved) I haven't? I'm okay? I'm okay? Oh, thank you, thank you, Doctor! I don't know how to thank you.
Setting: Hospital room|JERRY|(Sarcastic) Hey, that was really fun, George. Can we go home now?
Setting: Hospital room|DOCTOR|No, actually, we'd like to keep him here overnight for observation, just to be safe.
Setting: Hospital room|GEORGE|Oh, sure. Sure, anything. Can you believe it? There's nothing wrong with me.
Setting: Hospital room|DOCTOR|Well, I wouldn't go that far.
Setting: Hospital room|GEORGE|(Starting to panic again) What? Oh my God. What? Is it meningitis? Scoliosis? Lupis?! Is it Lupis?!
Setting: Hospital room|DOCTOR|Have you ever had your tonsils taken out?
Setting: Hospital room|GEORGE|My tonsils? Yeah, when I was a kid.
Setting: Hospital room|DOCTOR|Well, they've grown back. Your adenoids are swollen too.
Setting: Hospital room|GEORGE|Really?
Setting: Hospital room|ELAINE|(Jokingly hits the doctor) Whose tonsils grow back? (Laughs)
Setting: Hospital room|DOCTOR|It happens.
Setting: Hospital room|JERRY|Yeah, if you've been exposed to gamma rays.
Setting: Hospital room|ELAINE|I still have my tonsils. Everyone in my family has their tonsils. In fact, we were forbidden to socialize with anyone who didn't have their tonsils.
Setting: Hospital room|DOCTOR|That's interesting. Because, no one in my family has their tonsils, and we were forbidden to socialize with tonsil people.
Setting: Hospital room|JERRY|(Sarcastically) Well, it's like the Capulets and the Montagues.
Setting: Hospital room|GEORGE|(Drawing attention back to him) Excuse me!
Setting: Hospital room|DOCTOR|Anyway, I strongly recommend they come out.
Setting: Hospital room|GEORGE|What? You mean with a knife?
Setting: Hospital room|DOCTOR|Yes. With a knife. You know, snip, snip. Anyway, you'd be completely under, you wouldn't feel a thing. And when you wake up, you can have some ice cream.
Setting: Hospital room|GEORGE|(Angry) Yeah, that's what they told me the last time.
Setting: Hospital room|DOCTOR|Think about it. (Turns to leave, but runs into Elaine) Excuse me.
Setting: Hospital room|ELAINE|(Flustered) Oh, I'm sorry. (Doctor exits) I just.. have to ask that doctor one more question. (Leaves)
Setting: Hospital room|JERRY|Women go after doctors like men go after models. They want someone with knowledge of the body.. we just want the body.
Setting: Hospital room|action|Kramer enters, eating off a tray of hospital food
Setting: Hospital room|KRAMER|Hey.
Setting: Hospital room|JERRY|Hey.
Setting: Hospital room|KRAMER|Boy, they got a great cafeteria downstairs. Hot food, sandwiches, a salad bar.. It's like a Sizzler's opened up a hospital! (Sits and starts eating) So, how did you have a heart attack? You're a young man. What were you doing? Are they gonna do a zipper job? Oh, they love to do zipper jobs.
Setting: Hospital room|JERRY|(Trying to shut him up) Kramer.
Setting: Hospital room|KRAMER|The really bad thing about the heart is the sex thing. See, you gotta be careful about sex now. You get that heart pumping and suddenly, boom! Next thing you know, you got a hose coming out of your chest attached to a piece of luggage.
Setting: Hospital room|JERRY|Kramer, George didn't have a heart attack.
Setting: Hospital room|KRAMER|No? That's good.
Setting: Hospital room|GEORGE|I have to have my tonsils taken out.
Setting: Hospital room|KRAMER|Oh man.. No.. George, we gotta get you outta here. Get out! Right now! They'll kill ya in here.
Setting: Hospital room|JERRY|(Trying to calm George down) It's routine surgery.
Setting: Hospital room|KRAMER|Oh yeah? My friend, Bob Saccomanno, he came in here for a hernia operation.. Oh yeah, routine surgery.. now he's sittin' around in a chair by a window going, "My name is Bob" .. George, whatever you do, don't let 'em cut you. Don't let 'em cut you..
Setting: Hospital room|GEORGE|Well, what should I do, Kramer?
Setting: Hospital room|JERRY|Well, for one think, don't listen to him.
Setting: Hospital room|KRAMER|I'll tell you what to do, I'll tell you what to do. You go to Tor Eckman. Tor, Tor, he'll fix you right up. He's a herbalist, a healer, George. He's not just gonna fix the tonsils and the adenoids, he is gonna change the whole way you function - body and mind.
Setting: Hospital room|JERRY|Eckman? I thought he was doing time?
Setting: Hospital room|KRAMER|No, no, he's out. He got out. See, the medical establishment, see, they tried to frame him. It's all politics. But he's a rebel.
Setting: Hospital room|JERRY|A rebel? No. Johnny Yuma was a rebel. Eckman is a nut. George, you want to take care of your tonsils, you do it in a hospital. With a doctor.
Setting: Hospital room|KRAMER|He's holistic, George. He's holistic.
Setting: Hospital room|GEORGE|Holistic.. that sounds right.
Setting: Hospital room|JERRY|George, you need a medical doctor.
Setting: Hospital room|GEORGE|(To Jerry) Let me ask you something.. How much do you think it would cost to have tonsils and adenoids removed in the hospital?
Setting: Hospital room|JERRY|Well, an overnight stay in a hospital? Minor surgery? I dunno, four grand.
Setting: Hospital room|GEORGE|Uh-huh. And how much does the healer charge?
Setting: Hospital room|KRAMER|First visit? Thirty-eight bucks.
Setting: Hospital room|GEORGE|Oh, yeah? Holistic.. that's what I need. That's the answer.

Setting: Healer's apartment|JERRY|Don't flatter yourself, my friend. I'm here strictly for material, and I have a feeling this is a potential gold mine.. I still think you're nuts, though.
Setting: Healer's apartment|GEORGE|All I know is I've been going to doctors all my life. What has it gotten me? I'm thirty-three years old. I haven't outgrown the problems of puberty, I'm already facing the problems of old age. I completely skipped healthy adulthood. I went from having orgasms immediately to taking forever. You could do your taxes in the time it takes me to have an orgasm. I've never had a normal, medium orgasm.
Setting: Healer's apartment|JERRY|(Jokingly making fun of George) I've never had a really good pickle.
Setting: Healer's apartment|GEORGE|Besides, what's it gonna cost me? Thirty-eight bucks?

Setting: Healer's apartment|GEORGE|Really?
Setting: Healer's apartment|TOR|Do you use hot water in the shower?
Setting: Healer's apartment|GEORGE|Yes.
Setting: Healer's apartment|TOR|Stop using it.
Setting: Healer's apartment|GEORGE|..Okay.
Setting: Healer's apartment|KRAMER|I'm off hot water.
Setting: Healer's apartment|TOR|Kramer tells me that you are interested in an alternative to surgery.
Setting: Healer's apartment|GEORGE|Yes, yes I am.
Setting: Healer's apartment|TOR|(Blows into George's face) I think we can help you. See, unfortunately, the medical establishment is a business like any other business. And business needs customers. And, they want to sell you their most expensive item which is unnecessary surgery.
Setting: Healer's apartment|GEORGE|(Still on the showers) Can I use hot water on my face?
Setting: Healer's apartment|TOR|No. You know, I am not a business man. I'm a holistic healer. It's a calling, it's a gift. You see, it's in the best interest of the medical profession that you remain sick. You see, that insures good business. You're not a patient. You're a customer.
Setting: Healer's apartment|JERRY|(He thinks this, the audience can hear his thoughts) And you're not a doctor, but you play one in real life.
Setting: Healer's apartment|GEORGE|(Still on the hot water) What about shaving?
Setting: Healer's apartment|TOR|(To Jerry) You're eating too much dairy. (To George) May I? (Reaches over, and touches George's face)
Setting: Healer's apartment|GEORGE|I guess so.
Setting: Healer's apartment|TOR|(Feeling George's face) You see, you are in disharmony. The throat is the gateway to the lung. Tonsillitis, adenoiditis, is, in Chinese medical terms, and invasion of heat and wind.
Setting: Healer's apartment|JERRY|(Again, we hear his thoughts) There's some hot air blowing in here..
Setting: Healer's apartment|TOR|You know, I lived with the Eskimos many years ago, and they used to plunge their faces into the snow.
Setting: Healer's apartment|GEORGE|(Once again, still on the shower) Could it be lukewarm?

"Feel great.. like being on the respirator.. intravenous heart/lung machine. I never felt better in my life." Medical science is making advances every day in control health problems. In fact, it's probably only a matter of time before a heart attack, you know, becomes like, a head ache. We'll just see people on TV going, "I had a heart attack this big (Holds out hands, gesturing bigness) ..but, I gave myself one of these. Clear!
