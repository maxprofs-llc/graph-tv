Gym Locker Room|GEORGE|You know Keith, what I've always wondered, with all these ball clubs flying around all season don't you think there would be a plane crash? ...
Gym Locker Room|KEITH|(to Jerry) Do you perform anywhere in new York right now?
Gym Locker Room|JERRY|I'm performing in this club on the east Side. You should come in.
Gym Locker Room|GEORGE|But if you think about it...26 teams, 162 games a season, you'd think eventually an entire team would get wiped out.
Gym Locker Room|KEITH|You know, I live on the East Side.
Gym Locker Room|JERRY|I'll tell you what, I'll give you my number and uh, just give me a call, tell me whenever you want to go.

Monks|ELAINE|Sometimes I've given my number out to guys and it takes them a month to call.
Monks|JERRY|Hu, good, good,... well if he's calling in a month he's got a prayer!

Jerry's Apartment|JERRY|Hellooo Newman.
Jerry's Apartment|KRAMER|I hate KEITH HERNANDEZ - hate him.
Jerry's Apartment|NEWMAN|I despise him.
Jerry's Apartment|ELAINE|Why?
Jerry's Apartment|NEWMAN|Why? I'll tell you why...
Jerry's Apartment|KRAMER|Let me tell it ..
Jerry's Apartment|NEWMAN|No, you can't tell it ..
Jerry's Apartment|KRAMER|You always tell it ..
Jerry's Apartment|NEWMAN|All right, tell it.
Jerry's Apartment|KRAMER|Ja ja ja - just tell it
Jerry's Apartment|NEWMAN|June 14, 1987.... Mets Phillies. We're enjoying a beautiful afternoon in the right field stands when a crucial Hernandez error to a five run Phillies ninth. Cost the Mets the game.
Jerry's Apartment|KRAMER|Our day was ruined. There was a lot of people, you know, they were waiting by the player's parking lot. Now we're coming down the ramp ... [cut to film of the day - like the Zabruter film - with the Umbrella man and everything - Oh so brilliant parody!!!] ... Newman was in front of me. Keith was coming toward us, as he passes Newman turns and says, " Nice game pretty boy.". Keith continued past us up the ramp.
Jerry's Apartment|NEWMAN|A second later, something happened that changed us in a deep and profound way front that day forward.
Jerry's Apartment|ELAINE|What was it?
Jerry's Apartment|KRAMER|He spit on us.... and I screamed out, "I'm hit!"
Jerry's Apartment|NEWMAN|Then I turned and the spit ricochet of him and it hit me.
Jerry's Apartment|ELAINE|Wow! What a story.
Jerry's Apartment|JERRY|Unfortunately the immutable laws of physics contradict the whole premise of your account. Allow me to reconstruct this if I may for Miss Benes as I've heard this story a number of times.
Jerry's Apartment|JERRY|Newman, Kramer, if you'll indulge me. According to your story Keith passes you and starts walking up the ramp then you say you were struck on the right temple. The spit then proceeds to ricochet off the temple striking Newman between the third and forth rib. The spit then cam off the rib turned and hit Newman in the right wrist causing him to drop his baseball cap. The spit then splashed off the wrist, Pauses In mid air mind you- makes a left turn and lands on Newman's left thigh. That is one magic luggie.
Jerry's Apartment|NEWMAN|Well that's the way it happened.
Jerry's Apartment|JERRY|What happened to your head when you got hit?
Jerry's Apartment|KRAMER|Well. uh, well my head went back and to the left
Jerry's Apartment|JERRY|Again
Jerry's Apartment|KRAMER|Back and to the left
Jerry's Apartment|JERRY|Back and to the left Back and to the left
Jerry's Apartment|ELAINE|So, what are you saying?
Jerry's Apartment|JERRY|I am saying that the spit could not have come from behind ... that there had to have been a second spitter behind the bushes on the gravelly road. If the spitter was behind you as you claimed that would have caused your head to pitch forward.
Jerry's Apartment|ELAINE|So the spit could have only come from the front and to the right.
Jerry's Apartment|JERRY|But that is not what they would have you believe.
Jerry's Apartment|NEWMAN|I'm leavin'. Jerry's a nut. (Exits)
Jerry's Apartment|KRAMER|Wait, wait, (Exits)
Jerry's Apartment|JERRY|The sad thing is we may never know the real truth.
Jerry's Apartment|action|George runs in
Jerry's Apartment|GEORGE|(Frantically) Did anybody call here asking for Vandelay industries?
Jerry's Apartment|JERRY|No. What happened to you?
Jerry's Apartment|GEORGE|Now, listen closely. I was at the unemployment office and I told them that I was very close to getting a job with Vandelay Industries and I gave them your phone number. So, when now when the phone rings you've got to answer "Vandelay Industries".

Jerry's Apartment|JERRY|I'm going to hire you as my latex salesman?
Jerry's Apartment|GEORGE|Right.
Jerry's Apartment|JERRY|I don't think so. Why would I do that?
Jerry's Apartment|GEORGE|Because I asked you to.
