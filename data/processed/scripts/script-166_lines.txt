Setting: Jerry's apartment|ELAINE|What were your.. demands?
Setting: Jerry's apartment|KRAMER|Yeah, 5.35 an hour. And that's what they're paying now.
Setting: Jerry's apartment|ELAINE|I believe that's the new minimum wage.

Setting: Kruger's office|KRUGER|George, we have a problem. There's a memo, here, from accounting telling me there's no such thing as the Human Fund.
Setting: Kruger's office|GEORGE|Well, there could be.
Setting: Kruger's office|KRUGER|But there isn't.
Setting: Kruger's office|GEORGE|Well, I - I could, Uh, I could give the money back. Here. (Holds it out)
Setting: Kruger's office|KRUGER|George, I don't get it. If there's no Human Fund, those donation cards were fake. You better have a damn good reason why you gave me a fake Christmas gift.
Setting: Kruger's office|GEORGE|Well, sir, I - I gave out the fake card, because, um, I don't really celebrate Christmas. I, um, I celebrate Festivus.
Setting: Kruger's office|KRUGER|Vemonous?
Setting: Kruger's office|GEORGE|Festivus, Sir. And, uh, I was afraid that I would be persecuted for my beliefs. They drove my family out of Bayside, Sir!
Setting: Kruger's office|KRUGER|Are you making all this up, too?
Setting: Kruger's office|GEORGE|Oh, no, Sir. Festivus is all too real. And.. I could prove it - if I had to.

Setting: The Costanza's house|JERRY|I thought you were on strike?
Setting: The Costanza's house|KRAMER|Well, I caved. I mean, I really had to use their bathroom. Frank, no offence, but this holiday is a little (makes a series of noises) out there.
