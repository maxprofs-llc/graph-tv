Elaine's Apartment|ELAINE|HE reads everything, you know, Ned's very well read.
Elaine's Apartment|GEORGE|Maybe he's just "very well RED"?
Elaine's Apartment|ELAINE|Communist? Don't you think he probably would have told me?
Elaine's Apartment|GEORGE|Well, does he wear bland, drab, olive colored clothing?
Elaine's Apartment|ELAINE|Yes, . . . yes he does dress a little drab.
Elaine's Apartment|GEORGE|Huh, he's a communist. . . . Look at this. "Exciting uninhibited woman seeks forward thinking comrade and appearance not important." . . . Appearance Not Important! This is unbelievable. Finally this is an ideology I can embrace.
Elaine's Apartment|action|Jerry enters
Elaine's Apartment|JERRY|Hi oh.
Elaine's Apartment|ELAINE|Where's Lois?
Elaine's Apartment|JERRY|She couldn't make it.
Elaine's Apartment|GEORGE|I can't believe you're really going out with a woman named Lois.
Elaine's Apartment|JERRY|I know, finally. But George, guess who her boss is. Duncan Meyers.
Elaine's Apartment|GEORGE|Duncan Meyers?
Elaine's Apartment|ELAINE|Who's he?
Elaine's Apartment|JERRY|Elaine, only one other person in the world knows what I am about to tell you and that's George. When we were in the ninth grade they had us all line up at one end of the school yard for this big race to see who was going to represent the school in this track meet.
Elaine's Apartment|ELAINE|Uh uh
Elaine's Apartment|JERRY|I was the last one on the end. George was next to me. And Mr. Bevilacqua, the gym . . .
Elaine's Apartment|ELAINE|What's that?
Elaine's Apartment|JERRY|Mr. Bevilacqua, the gym teacher.
Elaine's Apartment|ELAINE|Oh, of course.
Elaine's Apartment|JERRY|He was down at the other end. So he yells out, "Ready, On your mark, Get set, " and I was so keyed up I just took off. By the time he said go I was ten yards ahead of everybody.
Elaine's Apartment|ELAINE|No.
Elaine's Apartment|GEORGE|I looked up. I couldn't believe it.
Elaine's Apartment|JERRY|By the time the race was over I had won. I was shocked nobody had noticed the head start.
Elaine's Apartment|ELAINE|Really?
Elaine's Apartment|JERRY|And I had won by so much a myth began to grow about my speed. Only Duncan suspected something was a miss. He's hated me ever since. Now he's back.
Elaine's Apartment|ELAINE|Well what happened when you raced him again?
Elaine's Apartment|JERRY|I never did. In four years of high school I would never race anyone again. Not even to the end of the block to catch a bus. And so the legend grew. Everyone wanted me to race. They begged me. The track coach called my parents. Pleading. Telling them it was a sin to waste my god given talent. But I answered him in the same way I answered everyone. I chose not to run.
Elaine's Apartment|ELAINE|So now Duncan is back?
Elaine's Apartment|JERRY|He's back. And I knew he would be someday. (drinks) Man that's some tart cider!
In Jerry's Car - Lois gets in|JERRY|Hi.

In Jerry's Car - Lois gets in|LOIS|About what?
In Jerry's Car - Lois gets in|JERRY|Oh, nothing in particular.
In Jerry's Car - Lois gets in|LOIS|. . . Why did you cheat in that race?
In Jerry's Car - Lois gets in|JERRY|I did not cheat.
In Jerry's Car - Lois gets in|LOIS|He said that you got a head start.
In Jerry's Car - Lois gets in|JERRY|Oh, he's just jealous because he came in second.
In Jerry's Car - Lois gets in|LOIS|Really?
In Jerry's Car - Lois gets in|JERRY|Yes

Monks|GEORGE|You know my driver's waiting, I really should get running. Good to see you guys again.
Monks|JERRY|George, George, hang on. I haven't seen you in so long.
Monks|GEORGE|Ha, uh,
Monks|JERRY|I thought we might reminisce a little more. You know Duncan and I were just taking about the big race.
Monks|GEORGE|Oh, the big race.
Monks|JERRY|Yeah.
Monks|GEORGE|Yes, yes,.
Monks|LOIS|You were there?
Monks|GEORGE|Yes, sure, surely was. Yeah, I'll remember that day. Well I'll never forget it because that was the day that I uh, lost my virginity to Miss. Stafford, the uh, voluptuous home room teacher.
Monks|DUNCAN|Miss Stafford?
Monks|GEORGE|Yes, yes, you know I was in detention and she came up behind me while I was erasing the blackboard . . .
Monks|JERRY|George!
Monks|GEORGE|But I digress. Let me see, now. You were standing at one end of the line and I was right next to you. And I remember we were even for like, the first five yards and then , BOOM,...You were gone.
Monks|JERRY|Did I get a head start?
Monks|GEORGE|Head start, oh no absolutely not.
Monks|JERRY|You satisfied? So you see?

Street|KRAMER|There are no delicatessens under Communism.

They kind of distract you while you're smoking. The red and yellow are nice. It looks good against the brown of the cigar. The Maduro, I like the Maduro wrapper. The darker the better, that's what I say. Of course, the Claro's good too. That's more of a pale brown, almost like a milky coffee. (George exits) I find the ring size very confusing. They have it in centimeters which I don't really understand that well...

Of course the problem with parties is you invariably have to eat standing up which I don't care for but on the other hand I don't like to balance a plate on my lap either. Once when I was at a party, I put my plate on someone's piano. I assure you, if I had not been a dictator, I would not have been able to get away with that one.
