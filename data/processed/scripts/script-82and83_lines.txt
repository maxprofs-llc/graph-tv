Jerry's Apartment|KRAMER|How serendipitous.
Jerry's Apartment|MORTY|So that night I cut off the loops and the Executive was born.
Jerry's Apartment|KRAMER|Mmm
Jerry's Apartment|JERRY|He also came up with an idea for a brimless rain-hat but that never materialized. (to Morty) Alright come on let's play.

Jerry's Apartment|GEORGE|Hey could you do one other thing for me?
Jerry's Apartment|JERRY|Name it.
Jerry's Apartment|GEORGE|You think your parents would have any objections to taking a little kid to Paris with them? (Jerry looks at him confused) It turns out that the kid's father lives in Paris. (chuckling) Is that a coincidence? (Jerry smilies) Eh you know Alec wants me to take him over there so I figure as long as they're going (claps)
Jerry's Apartment|JERRY|So you thought as long as they're mailing postcards, it wouldn't be too much to ask my parents to drag a child who they've never seen, through the streets of Paris?
Jerry's Apartment|GEORGE|(pause) Alright if you think it's too much they don't have to mail the postcards.
