Opening Monologue|JERRY|I have a friend who is about to get married, they're having the bachelor party and the bridal shower on the same day... So it's conceivable that while she's getting the lingerie, he'd be at a nude bar watching a table dancer wearing the same outfit. That is possible. But to me, the difference between being single and being married, is the form of government. You see, when you're single, you are the dictator of your own life. I have complete power. I can give the order to fall asleep on the sofa with the TV on in the middle of the day, no-one can overrule me! When you're married, you're part of a vast decision-making body. Before anything gets done there are meetings. Committees have to study the situation. And this is if the marriage works. That's what's so painful about divorce: you get impeached and you're not even the president!
Jerry's apartment|GEORGE|Hey, is it my imagination, or do really good looking women walk a lot faster than everybody else?
Jerry's apartment|ELAINE|We don't walk that fast...
Jerry's apartment|GEORGE|No seriously...
Jerry's apartment|ELAINE|Seriously, we don't.
Jerry's apartment|GEORGE|The better looking they are, the faster they go! I mean, I see they out there on the street, they're zooming around, like a blur. Like they have a motor on their ass.
Jerry's apartment|ELAINE|(Yelling to Jerry in the bedroom) Hey Jerry, come on, let's go. We're gonna miss the previews!
Jerry's apartment|ELAINE|Hey, how are we gettin' to Scott Drake's party on Saturday night?
Jerry's apartment|JERRY|Oh, Drake's party, I forgot to buy a present.
Jerry's apartment|GEORGE|I gotta buy a present now?
Jerry's apartment|ELAINE|Of course you do, it's an engagement party.
Jerry's apartment|GEORGE|It never ends, this present stuff! Engagement present! Then they get married, you gonna have to get them something for that! Then the baby, there's another present. Then the baby starts getting their presents. I don't even like Drake.
Jerry's apartment|JERRY|You don't like the Drake?
Jerry's apartment|GEORGE|Hate the Drake.
Jerry's apartment|ELAINE|I *love* the Drake.
Jerry's apartment|JERRY|How could you not like the Drake?
Jerry's apartment|GEORGE|Who's the Drake?
Jerry's apartment|ELAINE|"Who's the Drake"?
Jerry's apartment|JERRY|The Drake is good!
Jerry's apartment|ELAINE|So listen, what are you gonna get him?
Jerry's apartment|GEORGE|I haven't even met the fiancee! Whatever! (Leaves for washroom)
Jerry's apartment|JERRY|Elaine, look. I drew this triangle free-hand. It's a doodle. It's perfect!
Jerry's apartment|ELAINE|So what? That's easy.

Jerry's apartment|JERRY|Do you like the Drake?
Jerry's apartment|KRAMER|I *love* the Drake! I'm looking forward to meeting the Drakette!
Jerry's apartment|ELAINE|I'm lukewarm about the Drakette.
Jerry's apartment|KRAMER|(Looking at Jerry's doodle) That's a nice triangle...
Jerry's apartment|JERRY|It's Isosceles
Jerry's apartment|KRAMER|Ooh, Isosceles. I love the name Isosceles. If I had a kid, I would name him Isosceles. Isosceles Kramer.
Jerry's apartment|ELAINE|Hey, you know what, maybe we should all chip in for the gift.
Jerry's apartment|JERRY|The chip-in!
Jerry's apartment|ELAINE|Hey, a pretty good idea, huh?
Jerry's apartment|JERRY|Yeah!
Jerry's apartment|KRAMER|Yeah, the chip-in, defenitely!
Jerry's apartment|JERRY|You know what, let's go to that mall in Liberal(sp?) before we go to the party. We'll have to take your car, it's got the most room.

Jerry's apartment|JERRY|What about your father's car?
Jerry's apartment|GEORGE|No, no, no. Out of the question. I was over there today. He's got the good spot in front of the good building in the good neighbourhood. I know he's not gonna wanna move.
Jerry's apartment|JERRY|Are you serious?
Jerry's apartment|GEORGE|You don't know what that spot means to him. Once he gets it, he doesn't go out for weeks.
Jerry's apartment|JERRY|How about this, you put your car in the good spot, that'll hold the good spot in front of the good building, and we can get the good car!
Jerry's apartment|GEORGE|Good thinking!
Jerry's apartment|JERRY|Good to meet you!

George's father's car|GEORGE|Look at this. There's no spaces here. (to another car) Excuse me, are you gettin' out?
George's father's car|KRAMER|Why don't you take a handicap spot...
George's father's car|GEORGE|You think?
George's father's car|ELAINE|No, no! We'll find a space. There's spaces in the other lot.
George's father's car|GEORGE|I don't want to walk that far.
George's father's car|ELAINE|What if a handicapped person needs it?
George's father's car|KRAMER|Oh, come on, they don't drive!
George's father's car|JERRY|Yes, they do!
George's father's car|KRAMER|Have you ever seen a handicapped person pull into a space and park?
George's father's car|JERRY|Well there's spaces there, they must drive!
George's father's car|KRAMER|Well they don't. If they could drive, they wouldn't be handicapped.
George's father's car|ELAINE|So if you can drive, you're not handicapped?
George's father's car|GEORGE|Look, we're not gonna be that long anyway... we have to get to the "party"!
George's father's car|KRAMER|I got news for you: handicapped people, they don't even want to park there! They wanna be treated just like anybody else! That's why, those spaces are always empty.
George's father's car|GEORGE|He's right! It's the same thing with the femenists. You know, they want everything to be equal, everything! But when the check comes, where are they?
George's father's car|ELAINE|What does that mean?
George's father's car|GEORGE|Yeah! Alright, I'm pulling in.
George's father's car|KRAMER|Yeah, go ahead.

coffee shop|GEORGE|What are we gonna do? How are we gonna get out of here?
coffee shop|JERRY|The thing is, even if we go back by the car, and there's nobody there, how do we know they're not all hiding, waiting for us?
coffee shop|ELAINE|Well, they have to give up some time, they can't stay out there all night?
coffee shop|JERRY|What are we, John Dillinger? How did this get to be the crime of the century? It's not like we stuck a broomstick in her spokes and she went flying...
coffee shop|GEORGE|What I don't get is, just because the battery is dead, you think she'd be able to roll up the hill with her hands!
coffee shop|KRAMER|You'd think...
coffee shop|GEORGE|I mean, batteries have gone dead before, aren't they prepared for that?
coffee shop|KRAMER|Most of them don't even have batteries.
coffee shop|GEORGE|Must be one of those rich, spoiled handicapped people, who didn't want to do any work, and just wanted to sit in her wheelchair and take it easy.
coffee shop|KRAMER|Yeah...
coffee shop|GEORGE|Well, I'm sorry!
coffee shop|ELAINE|Our big screen TV is probably arriving right now...
coffee shop|GEORGE|How are we gonna get out of here? We need a plan!

coffee shop|ELAINE|I'm not going for this, Kramer should go! It was all his idea!
coffee shop|KRAMER|No chance in hell!
coffee shop|JERRY|What if we created some sort of diversion? What if we all went by the car and started screaming: "There he is, there's the guy that took the handicap spot!" And then, when they all run into the other direction, we'll jump in the car!
coffee shop|GEORGE|That's good, we'll give it a try...
coffee shop|ELAINE|That's good...
