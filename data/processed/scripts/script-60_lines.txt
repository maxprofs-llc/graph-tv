Closing monologue.|JERRY|Ages zero through ten, candy is your life. There's nothing else. Family, friends, school-- they're only obstacles in the way of getting more candy. And you have your favorite candies that you love. You know the ones I love those... I hate those...''. ``I hate those... I love those...''.  And only a seven year old kid could actually taste the difference between like a red M&M; and a light brown, M&M.; That's two totally different things when you're seven years old. "Well, your red is more of a main course M&M;, but the brown it's more of a mellower flavor; it's an after dinner M&M;, really''.
