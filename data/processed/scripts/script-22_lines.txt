OPENING MONOLOGUE|JERRY|Does it seem to you that the ventriloquist dummy has a very active sexual social life? he's always talking about dates and women that he knows and bringing them back to the suitcase at night, there's always a sawdust joke in there somewhere you know, kinky things cuz he's made out of wood an' he can spin his head around, we're somehow expected to believe because the face is soo animated that they think we aren't noticing that the feet are just swinging there, dummy feet never look right do they? they're just kinda dangling there, always kinda askew you know? you always see just little ankle, those thin fabric ankles that they have you know. Ya think 'I don't think this thing is real.'
JERRY'S APARTMENT|JERRY|Let me speak with the head librarian. ... Because it's absurd. An overdue book from 1971? ... This is a joke right? What are you? From a radio station?
JERRY'S APARTMENT|KRAMER|enters
JERRY'S APARTMENT|JERRY|Ya' got me I fell for it. Alright, OK I can be down there in like a half hour. Bye.
JERRY'S APARTMENT|KRAMER|What's the problem?
JERRY'S APARTMENT|JERRY|This you're not goin' to believe. The NYPL says that I took out Tropic of Cancer in 1971 and never returned it.
JERRY'S APARTMENT|KRAMER|Do you know how much that comes to? That's a nickel a day for 20 years. It's going to be $50,000
JERRY'S APARTMENT|JERRY|It doesn't work like that.
JERRY'S APARTMENT|KRAMER|If it's a dime a day it could be $100,000
JERRY'S APARTMENT|JERRY|It's not going to be anything. I returned the book. I remember it very vividly because I was with Sherry Becker. She wore this orange dress. It was the first time I ever saw her in a dress like that. In oticed since ninth grade she was developing this body in secret under these loose clothes for like two years. And then one day ...
JERRY'S APARTMENT|JERRY|That orange dress is burned in my memory
JERRY'S APARTMENT|KRAMER|Oh, memory burn.
JERRY'S APARTMENT|JERRY|I wonder what ever happened to her.
JERRY'S APARTMENT|KRAMER|How did they ever find you?
JERRY'S APARTMENT|JERRY|Oh, computers, they're cracking down now on overdue books. The whole thing is completely ridiculous.

LIBRARY|READER|Shhh.
LIBRARY|KRAMER|Tryin' to save a quarter.
LIBRARY|JERRY|I kinda like those sticks. I'd like to get them in my house.
LIBRARY|JERRY|This woman's completely ignoring me.
LIBRARY|KRAMER|Look at her. This is a lonely woman looking for companionship.. ... Spinster. ... Maybe a virgin. ... Maybe she got hurt a long time ago. She was a schoolgirl. There was a boy It didn't work out. Now she needs a little tenderness. She needs a little understanding. She needs a little Kramer.
LIBRARY|JERRY|Eventually a little shot of penicillin
LIBRARY|LIBRARIAN|Yes?
LIBRARY|JERRY|Yeah I called before. I got his notice in the mail.
LIBRARY|LIBRARIAN|Oh, Tropic of Cancer, Henry Miller, Uh, this case has been turned over to our library investigation officer Mr. Bookman.
LIBRARY|KRAMER|Bookman? The library investigator's name is actually, Bookman?
LIBRARY|LIBRARIAN|It's true.
LIBRARY|KRAMER|That's amazing. That's like an ice cream man named, Cone.
LIBRARY|LIBRARIAN|Lt. Bookman has been working here for 25 years so I think he's heard all the jokes.

PENDANT PUBLISHING OFFICES|SECRETARY|She must have forgot.
PENDANT PUBLISHING OFFICES|ELAINE|How could she forget I've been ordering lunch every day here for 3 and a half years?
PENDANT PUBLISHING OFFICES|SECRETARY|I don't know anything.
PENDANT PUBLISHING OFFICES|ELAINE|Ah, you don't know anything. You see, "I don't know anything", means there's something to know. If you really didn't know anything you would have said "You're crazy."

AT MONKS|GEORGE|I don't understand lunch, I don't know anything about lunch. Listen. Just because I got the guy fired doesn't mean I turned him into a bum - does it?
AT MONKS|ELAINE|What did he do?
AT MONKS|GEORGE|He purposely mispronounced my name. Instead of saying, "Costanza" He'd say, "Can't stand ja". "Can't stand ja" ... He made me smell my own gym socks once.
AT MONKS|JERRY|I remember he made you wear a jock on your head for a whole class. And the straps were hangin' down by his ,...
AT MONKS|GEORGE|OK, OK, I never even had him for gym.

BACK TO MONK'S|ELAINE|Why do they call it a wedgie?
BACK TO MONK'S|GEORGE|Because the underwear is pulled up from the back and ... it wedges in..
BACK TO MONK'S|JERRY|They also have an atomic wedgie. Now the goal there is to actually get the waistband on top of the head. Very rare.
BACK TO MONK'S|ELAINE|Boys are sick.

BACK TO MONK'S|KRAMER|Hey Babaloo, you better get home. You know this guy Bookman from the library he's waiting for ya.
MIDDLE MONOLOGUE|JERRY|What's amazing to me about the library is it's a place where you go in you can take out any book you whant they just give it to you and say bring it back when you're done. It reminds me of like this pathetic friend that everbody had when they were a little kid who would let you borrow any of his stuff if you would just be his friend. That's what the library is. A government funded pathetic friend. And that's why everybody kinds of bullies the library. I'll bring it back on time ... I'll bring it back late. ... Oh, what are you going to do? Charge me a nickel?
JERRY'S APARTMENT|JERRY|Oh, I'm glad you're here, so we can get this all straightened out. Would you like a cup of tea?
JERRY'S APARTMENT|BOOKMAN|You got any coffee?
JERRY'S APARTMENT|JERRY|Coffee?
JERRY'S APARTMENT|BOOKMAN|Yeah. Coffee.
JERRY'S APARTMENT|JERRY|No, I don't drink coffee.
JERRY'S APARTMENT|BOOKMAN|Yeah, you don't drink coffee? How about instant coffee?
JERRY'S APARTMENT|JERRY|No, I don't have--
JERRY'S APARTMENT|BOOKMAN|You don't have any instant coffee?
JERRY'S APARTMENT|JERRY|Well, I don't normally--
JERRY'S APARTMENT|BOOKMAN|Who doesn't have instant coffee?
JERRY'S APARTMENT|JERRY|I don't.
JERRY'S APARTMENT|BOOKMAN|You buy a jar of Folger's Crystals, you put it in the cupboard, you forget about it. Then later on when you need it, it's there. It lasts forever. It's freeze-dried. Freeze-dried Crystals.
JERRY'S APARTMENT|JERRY|Really? I'll have to remember that.
JERRY'S APARTMENT|BOOKMAN|You took this book out in 1971.
JERRY'S APARTMENT|JERRY|Yes, and I returned it in 1971.
JERRY'S APARTMENT|BOOKMAN|Yeah, '71. That was my first year on the job. Bad year for libraries. Bad year for America. Hippies burning library cards, Abby Hoffman telling everybody to steal books. I don't judge a man by the length of his hair or the kind of music he listens to. Rock was never my bag. But you put on a pair of shoes when you walk into the New York Public Library, fella.
JERRY'S APARTMENT|JERRY|Look, Mr. Bookman. I--I returned that book. I remember it very specifically.
JERRY'S APARTMENT|BOOKMAN|You're a comedian, you make people laugh.
JERRY'S APARTMENT|JERRY|I try.
JERRY'S APARTMENT|BOOKMAN|You think this is all a big joke, don't you?
JERRY'S APARTMENT|JERRY|No, I don't.
JERRY'S APARTMENT|BOOKMAN|I saw you on T.V. once; I remembered your name--from my list. I looked it up. Sure enough, it checked out. You think because you're a celebrity that somehow the law doesn't apply to you, that you're above the law?
JERRY'S APARTMENT|JERRY|Certainly not.
JERRY'S APARTMENT|BOOKMAN|Well, let me tell you something, funny boy. Y'know that little stamp, the one that says "New York Public Library"? Well that may not mean anything to you, but that means a lot to me. One whole hell of a lot. Sure, go ahead, laugh if you want to. I've seen your type before: Flashy, making the scene, flaunting convention. Yeah, I know what you're thinking. What's this guy making such a big stink about old library books? Well, let me give you a hint, junior. Maybe we can live without libraries, people like you and me. Maybe. Sure, we're too old to change the world, but what about that kid, sitting down, opening a book, right now, in a branch at the local library and finding drawings of pee-pees and wee-wees on the Cat in the Hat and the Five Chinese Brothers? Doesn't HE deserve better? Look. If you think this is about overdue fines and missing books, you'd better think again. This is about that kid's right to read a book without getting his mind warped! Or: maybe that turns you on, Seinfeld; maybe that's how y'get your kicks. You and your good-time buddies. Well I got a flash for ya, joy-boy: Party time is over. Y'got seven days, Seinfeld. That is one week!

LIBRARY|MARIAN|HELLO!
LIBRARY|KRAMER|HELLO!

LIBRARY|BOOKMAN|I remember when the librarian was a much older woman: Kindly, discreet, unattractive. We didn't know anything about her private life. We didn't want to know anything about her private life. She didn't have a private life. While you're thinking about that, think about this: The library closes at five o'clock, no exceptions.
