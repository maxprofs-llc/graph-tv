Opening Monologue|JERRY|You know doctor is supposed to be such a prestigious occupation. But it’s really like one of the only jobs where you have to have your diploma right up there on the wall. It makes them seem so insecure, doesn’t it? "I really am a doctor you know. You think I’m not, just check it out." I don’t know why they need these little bits of psychological leverage over us all the time. "Go in that little room, take your pants off, wait 15 minutes, and I’ll give you my opinion." After that, anyone that comes in with pants on seems like they know what they’re talking about. In any difference of opinion, pants always beats no-pants.
At a restaurant.|GEORGE|Can I say one word to you? Lobster. The lobster here is unbelievable. (looks at the menu) Ooh, a little expensive.
At a restaurant.|SASHA|Twenty five dollars.
At a restaurant.|GEORGE|Yes, well, you know, I’m not thinking about the price. You know you’re the only woman I’ve never thought about the price. Get the lobster. I beg you to get the lobster. Go for the lobster.
At a restaurant.|SASHA|George, George, uh, I think we have to talk. I think we have a problem.
At a restaurant.|GEORGE|We do?
At a restaurant.|SASHA|We can’t keep seeing each other.
At a restaurant.|GEORGE|Why?
At a restaurant.|SASHA|(crying) Because it’s over. (sob, sob, sob) It’s my parents George, the differences in our religion. Oh George, can you ever forgive me? (sob)
At a restaurant.|SASHA|(crying) Yes. I’ll have the lobster.
At a restaurant.|GEORGE|Um, you know I’m starting to think that maybe lobster isn’t the way to go.

The hallway outside Jerry’s apartment.|GEORGE|She says we can’t go out anymore.
The hallway outside Jerry’s apartment.|ELAINE|Why?
The hallway outside Jerry’s apartment.|GEORGE|Because I’m not Latvian Orthodox. Her parents won’t let her get involved with anyone who isn’t Latvian Orthodox.
The hallway outside Jerry’s apartment.|ELAINE|Latvian Orthodox? (gasps) Mmm, it is lobster.
The hallway outside Jerry’s apartment.|JERRY|She’s limiting herself to Latvian Orthodox? Too bad.

The hallway outside Jerry’s apartment.|JERRY|To Latvian Orthodox?
The hallway outside Jerry’s apartment.|GEORGE|Why not? What do I care?
The hallway outside Jerry’s apartment.|JERRY|You know it’s not like changing toothpaste.

The hallway outside Jerry’s apartment.|GEORGE|King Edward. (snapping his fingers) King Edward, Jerry.
The hallway outside Jerry’s apartment.|JERRY|Yeah well King Edward didn’t live in Queens with Frank and Estelle Costanza.
The hallway outside Jerry’s apartment.|GEORGE|You know what? I could probably do this. What’s the difference.
The hallway outside Jerry’s apartment.|ELAINE|George I was just kidding around.
The hallway outside Jerry’s apartment.|GEORGE|No. I wouldn’t even have to tell her. I could surprise her.
The hallway outside Jerry’s apartment.|ELAINE|George I wasn’t serious.
The hallway outside Jerry’s apartment.|GEORGE|How hard could it be? You make a little contribution, you have a ceremony. I am going to think about this. I am really going to think about this.

At Monk’s.|ELAINE|You were snooping.
At Monk’s.|JERRY|I was not snooping. I did not break the seal. There was no breaking and entering. I wouldn’t do that.

Closing Monologue|JERRY|But once you put medicine in your medicine cabinet you're never using it again. Any medicine you're using, is on the sink. It's not really even a medicine cabinet, it's really like an ointment museum isn't it? It's like here's a saff from 1983, some cream from the 70s. But you want to keep it private, because a medicine cabinet is a place that reveals our weaknesses and it can really throw off the balance between two people that might be going out.
