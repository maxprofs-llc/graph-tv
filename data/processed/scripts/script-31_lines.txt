Jerry's Apartment|GEORGE|...pianist. A *classical* pianist. She *plays* the piano. She's a *brilliant* woman. I-I-I sat in her living room... She played the *Waldstein Sonata*! The *Waldstein*!
Jerry's Apartment|GEORGE|We did a crossword puzzle together, *in bed*. It was the most fun I ever had in my entire life. Did you hear me? in my *life*! Y'know?
Jerry's Apartment|action|Jerry enters
Jerry's Apartment|JERRY|Were you talking? I couldn't hear anything.
Jerry's Apartment|GEORGE|I was telling you about Noel.
Jerry's Apartment|JERRY|Oh, Noel! Yeah, the one who plays bongos...
Jerry's Apartment|GEORGE|[sarcastically] Heh heh heh... So side-splittingly funny...
Jerry's Apartment|JERRY|All right, I'm sorry. What about her?
Jerry's Apartment|GEORGE|What, you think I'm going to repeat the whole thing now?
Jerry's Apartment|JERRY|I know, you told me you like her, everything is going good.
Jerry's Apartment|GEORGE|No everything is *not* going good. I'm very uncomfortable. I have no power. I mean, why should she have the upper hand. *Once* in my life I would like the upper hand. I have no hand-- no hand at all. She has the hand; I have *no* hand...
Jerry's Apartment|GEORGE|How do I get the hand?
Jerry's Apartment|JERRY|We all want the hand. Hand is tough to get. You gotta get the hand right from the opening.
Jerry's Apartment|GEORGE|She's playing a recital this week at the McBierney School. You wanna hear her play? I got two extra tickets, you and Elaine could go...
Jerry's Apartment|JERRY|Yeah, that sounds like somethin'...
Jerry's Apartment|GEORGE|Then afterwards maybe we could all go out together. Y'know she'll see me with my friends, she'll observe me as I really am, as myself. Maybe I can get some hand that way.
Jerry's Apartment|action|Kramer enters
Jerry's Apartment|KRAMER|Hey, smell my arm... Smell it!
Jerry's Apartment|GEORGE|With all due respect, I don't think so...
Jerry's Apartment|JERRY|That smells good, what is that?
Jerry's Apartment|KRAMER|The *beach*!
Jerry's Apartment|JERRY|The *beach*?
Jerry's Apartment|GEORGE|What, did you go swimmin'? It's 29 degrees out!
Jerry's Apartment|KRAMER|I just joined the Polar Bear Club.
Jerry's Apartment|JERRY|You joined the *Polar Bears*?!
Jerry's Apartment|GEORGE|What the Hell is a "Polar Bear"?
Jerry's Apartment|KRAMER|Well, it's these people-- they go swimmin' in the winter. They're terrific, I just took my first swim today. Brrrrrrr! It's invigorating....
Jerry's Apartment|JERRY|Yeah... So's shock therapy.
Jerry's Apartment|JERRY|[with glee] What is that, a Pez dispenser?!
Jerry's Apartment|KRAMER|Want one? Yeah, I just bought it at the Flea Market.
Jerry's Apartment|GEORGE|Hey, what goes on there, exactly?
Jerry's Apartment|JERRY|You don't know?
Jerry's Apartment|GEORGE|No, I-I-I know... [retreats back to his Chinese take out] I know...
Jerry's Apartment|JERRY|You think they have fleas there, don't you?
Jerry's Apartment|GEORGE|*No*...
Jerry's Apartment|JERRY|Yes you do, Biff. You've never been to a Flea Market, and you think they have fleas there.
Jerry's Apartment|GEORGE|All right, I think they have fleas there. So what...
Jerry's Apartment|ELAINE|I don't know how anyone does this. It must be *so* nerve racking... How do they warm up their fingers?
Jerry's Apartment|JERRY|They have a piano backstage they warm up on.
Jerry's Apartment|ELAINE|*No*, we would have heard it.
Jerry's Apartment|JERRY|What, do you think they just crack their knuckles and come out?
Jerry's Apartment|GEORGE|I told her we'd all go out afterwards, okay? And don't applaud when she stops playing the first time. It's not over yet.
Jerry's Apartment|JERRY|[quickly whispering] I resent that you said that! That's directed at *me*, isn't it?!
Jerry's Apartment|action|A very elegant Noel comes out and sits at her piano.
Jerry's Apartment|JERRY|Is this okay? Can I do this? (he claps)
Jerry's Apartment|action|Noel begins. Dramatically. It's enough to make a man reach for his candy pooper. Jerry helps himself to a Pez, he stands Tweety up on Elaine's purse on her lap. Elaine valiantly tries to hold back her laughter, but it escalates from a giggle to a chortle to a chuckle to laughter to snorting. Noel is visibly shaken and she has difficulty playing with this anonymous distraction from one of the unwashed masses. Elaine removes herself from the auditorium, all the while snorting and gasping for breath, (we're talkin' full-on gales of laughter, here). Outside, she runs into an old acquaintance.
Jerry's Apartment|STEVE|Something I said? [no response] It's John... Mollika.
Jerry's Apartment|ELAINE|Oh, oh, *John*... Oh, hi John... Hi...
Jerry's Apartment|STEVE|What're you doing down here?
Jerry's Apartment|ELAINE|Oh, I was just at this recital and Jerry put a Pez dispenser on my leg and I started laughing.
Jerry's Apartment|MOLLIKA|Jerry's in there? I heard you guys broke up.
Jerry's Apartment|ELAINE|We did. We're just hanging out.
Jerry's Apartment|MOLLIKA|REally. ... You really look great.
Jerry's Apartment|ELAINE|Oh, uh, thank you. Are you still friends with Richie Appel?
Jerry's Apartment|MOLLIKA|Oh, Richie, he's been doing comedy in L. A. for a few years. He just got back a month ago. He's kind of messed up. On drugs. I don't know what to do for the guy.
Jerry's Apartment|ELAINE|Have you thought about an intervention?
Jerry's Apartment|MOLLIKA|What's that?
Jerry's Apartment|ELAINE|You get all his friends in a room, They confront himm to try to get him into rehab. It's a very popular thing now.
Jerry's Apartment|MOLLIKA|He'd never listen to anyone. ... Except of course Jerry. He'd listen to Jerry. Jerry would have to be involved. He really respects Jerry.
Jerry's Apartment|action|Cut to Jerry playing with Tweety Bird Pez dispenser.
Outside Noel's dressing room|GEORGE|What did you put the Pez dispenser on her leg for in the first place?
Outside Noel's dressing room|JERRY|I dunno, it was an impulse.
Outside Noel's dressing room|GEORGE|What kind of a sick impulse does that??
Outside Noel's dressing room|JERRY|How could I know she would start to laugh?
Outside Noel's dressing room|ELAINE|I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I *am*!
Outside Noel's dressing room|JERRY|Can we just go in already?
Outside Noel's dressing room|GEORGE|What are we gonna tell her?
Outside Noel's dressing room|ELAINE|I'll tell her I was the one who laughed.
Outside Noel's dressing room|GEORGE|No, don't say a word. If she thinks my friends are jerks, then I'm a *jerk*...
Outside Noel's dressing room|ELAINE|[To Jerry] Oh, remind me to talk to you about something later.
Outside Noel's dressing room|JERRY|What about?
Outside Noel's dressing room|GEORGE|Hey, hey! We're discussing something!
Outside Noel's dressing room|JERRY|I know, but I'm distracted now.
Outside Noel's dressing room|GEORGE|What are you? A *baby*!? All right. Tell her.
Outside Noel's dressing room|ELAINE|When I was outside I ran into John Mollika.
Outside Noel's dressing room|JERRY|Really John Mollika, they guy that used to bartend at the Comedy Club. How's he doing?
Outside Noel's dressing room|ELAINE|He's good.
Outside Noel's dressing room|GEORGE|Uh, can we cut to the chase?
Outside Noel's dressing room|JERRY|"Cut to the chase"?
Outside Noel's dressing room|GEORGE|Yeah...
Outside Noel's dressing room|JERRY|What're you, "Joe Hollywood"?
Outside Noel's dressing room|GEORGE|A lot of people say it.
Outside Noel's dressing room|JERRY|I would lose that.
Outside Noel's dressing room|GEORGE|[Accusingly] What's *that*?
Outside Noel's dressing room|JERRY|"Lose that"? That's not a Hollywood expression!
Outside Noel's dressing room|GEORGE|[Realizing full well it isn't] ...Yes it is.
Outside Noel's dressing room|ELAINE|Anyway ... So John told me that Richie is in town from Los Angeles and he's really messed up on drugs. So I told him that he should do an intervention.
Outside Noel's dressing room|JERRY|Really, an intervention ...
Outside Noel's dressing room|GEORGE|Y'know people, we got a situation over here!
Outside Noel's dressing room|ELAINE|Yeah, but he want's you to be a part of it.
Outside Noel's dressing room|JERRY|Me? Why me?
Outside Noel's dressing room|ELAINE|'Cause Richie really respects you and he would listen to you.

Outside Noel's dressing room|JERRY|You play a *Hell* of a piano.
Outside Noel's dressing room|ELAINE|Yeah, I was really moved, *really* moved.
Outside Noel's dressing room|NOEL|Well didn't you hear that person laughing? I couldn't play. I was *humiliated...
Outside Noel's dressing room|ELAINE|Well, I'm sure it wasn't *at* you.
Outside Noel's dressing room|NOEL|Well then, what was she laughing at?
Outside Noel's dressing room|JERRY|Pez?
Outside Noel's dressing room|NOEL|Uh, no, No thank you. Did you see her?
Outside Noel's dressing room|GEORGE|Me, uh, uh, no, ...
Outside Noel's dressing room|JERRY|Anyone who would laugh at a recital is probably some sort of lunatic anyway. I mean only a sick twisted mind could be that rude and ignorant.
Outside Noel's dressing room|ELAINE|Maybe some mental defective put something stupid on her leg.
Outside Noel's dressing room|JERRY|Even if this so called mental defective did put something on her leg she's still the one who laughed.
Outside Noel's dressing room|NOEL|I'll never forget that laugh for the rest of my life. [exits]
Outside Noel's dressing room|ELAINE|I'm sure she would apologize if she could. Probably somebody is holding her back against every fibre in her being.
Outside Noel's dressing room|GEORGE|If she want's to continue to have a fibre of her being she'll be very careful (hitting each other)
Noel enters|GEORGE|All right, so are you ready, so we'll go out and get something to eat.

MONKS|JERRY|You know I thing Kramer might have been responsible for getting Richie involved with drugs in the first place.
MONKS|ELAINE|What? How?
MONKS|JERRY|A few years ago the comedy club had a softball team. Kramer was our first baseman You couldn't get anything by him It was unbelievable. Anyway this one game we came back to win from like 8 runs behind. So Kramer says to Richie why don't you dump the bucket of Gatorade on Marty Benson's head? The club owner. So Richie goes ahead and does it.
MONKS|ELAINE|So? What happened?
MONKS|JERRY|What happened? The guy was like 67 years old, it was freezing out, he caught a cold, got pneumonia, and a month later he was dead.
MONKS|ELAINE|Shut up!
MONKS|JERRY|All the comedians were happy. He was one of these club owners nobodu liked anyway. But Richie was never the same.
MONKS|ELAINE|Whar about Kramer?
MONKS|JERRY|He's the same!
Jerry on phone at home|JERRY|Are you sure you want me John. I have spoken to Richie in two years. I don't have a good apartment for an intervention. The furniture, it's very non-confrontational. All right All right. Goodbye. [to Kramer] Remember Ricie Appel?

George enters|JERRY|What was on the list?
George enters|GEORGE|Let's see, How I'm very good at going in reverse in my car, why isn't Postum a more popular drink,
George enters|JERRY|Yeah, Postum is under-ratted,
George enters|GEORGE|Anyway there was all this tension. I asked her if she wanted to go out to dinner and she said "no, maybe we could get together for lunch." You know what that means.
George enters|JERRY|What's wrong with lunch?
George enters|GEORGE|Lunch is fine at the beginning then you move on to dinner. you don't move back to lunch. It's like being demoted. I'll never do another crossword puzzle with her again. I know it.
George enters|KRAMER|I like the Jumble You ever do the Jumble?
George enters|GEORGE|I have no power Do you understand? I need hand. I have no hand.
George enters|KRAMER|Break up with her
George enters|GEORGE|What?
George enters|KRAMER|You break up with her. You reverse everything that way.
George enters|JERRY|A preemptive breakup.
George enters|GEORGE|A preemptive breakup. This is an incredible idea. I got nothing to lose. We either break up which she would do anyway but at least I go out with some Dignity. Completely turn the tables. It's absolutely brilliant.
MONKS|GEORGE|So, I am have to going to break up with you.
MONKS|NOEL|You're breaking up with me?
MONKS|GEORGE|I, ... am breaking up with, ... you.

CALVIN KLEIN|STEVE|What about it?
CALVIN KLEIN|KRAMER|You know the way you smell when you first come home from the beach? Well, I want to make a cologne that captures the essence of that smell. Oh yeah.
CALVIN KLEIN|STEVE|That is the dumbest idea I have ever heard.
CALVIN KLEIN|KRAMER|Oh, wait, Did you here what I just said?
CALVIN KLEIN|STEVE|Do you think people are going to pay $80 a bottle to smell like dead fish and sea weed? That's why people take showers when the come home from the beach. It's an objectionable offensive odour.
CALVIN KLEIN|KRAMER|So you don't think it's a good idea?
