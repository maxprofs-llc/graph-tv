Setting: Night club|JERRY|I have never seen an old person in a new bathing suit in my life. I don't know where they get their bathing suits, but my father has bathing suits from other centuries. My parents live in Florida, and if you go down there and you forget your bathing suits then they want you to wear one of theirs. You know how that gets? "You need trunks son? I've got trunks for you. You can wear my trunks." Fathers don't wear bathing suits, they wear trunks. It's kind of the same thing a tree would wear if it went swimming. So I get in the water with in thing and it's like floating around me somewhere. Did you ever put on a bathing suit that you don't even know exactly where you are inside the bathing suit? You bump into somebody you know: "No I'm parasailing, I'm waiting for the boat to come back."

Setting: Florida, evening, condo of Jerry's parents|HELEN|I don't know why you had to rent a car. We would have picked you up.
Setting: Florida, evening, condo of Jerry's parents|JERRY|What's the difference?
Setting: Florida, evening, condo of Jerry's parents|HELEN|You could have used our car.
Setting: Florida, evening, condo of Jerry's parents|JERRY|I don't wanna use your car.

Setting: Florida, evening, condo of Jerry's parents|JERRY|It's not a speech. Do I have to make a speech?
Setting: Florida, evening, condo of Jerry's parents|HELEN|Of course, they're giving a testimonial for your father. You could do your comic routines.

Setting: Florida, evening, condo of Jerry's parents|JERRY|(tries to explain to Morty but Elaine then comes out of the guest room to get more luggage, so he fakes a conversation) ...but you know, look at the sun-dried tomatoes. Where were they five years ago? It just goes to show you. You never know what... huh (waiting for Elaine to go back in the guest room) you know... huh... What could happen to a vegetable. It could just take right off at any time. (Morty finally gets it. So Jerry goes on quieter) We've tried all kind of arrangements, but we can't seem to be friends when we sleep together.

Setting: Florida, evening, condo of Jerry's parents|JACK|This is an astronaut pen. It writes upside down. They use this in space.
Setting: Florida, evening, condo of Jerry's parents|JERRY|Wow! That's the astronaut pen. I heard about that. Where did you get it?
Setting: Florida, evening, condo of Jerry's parents|JACK|Oh it was a gift.
Setting: Florida, evening, condo of Jerry's parents|JERRY|Cause sometimes I write in bed and I have to turn and lean on my elbow to make the pen work.
Setting: Florida, evening, condo of Jerry's parents|JACK|Take the pen.
Setting: Florida, evening, condo of Jerry's parents|JERRY|Oh no.
Setting: Florida, evening, condo of Jerry's parents|JACK|Go ahead.

Setting: Florida, evening, condo of Jerry's parents|JERRY|What he gave it to me.
Setting: Florida, evening, condo of Jerry's parents|HELEN|You didn't have to take it.
Setting: Florida, evening, condo of Jerry's parents|MORTY|Oh my God! She's gotta make a big deal out of everything.
Setting: Florida, evening, condo of Jerry's parents|JERRY|He offered it to me.
Setting: Florida, evening, condo of Jerry's parents|HELEN|Because you made such a big fuss about it.
Setting: Florida, evening, condo of Jerry's parents|JERRY|I liked it. Should I have said I didn't like it?
Setting: Florida, evening, condo of Jerry's parents|HELEN|You shouldn't have said anything. What did you expect him to do? (the camera shows Elaine shaking her head at their dispute)
Setting: Florida, evening, condo of Jerry's parents|JERRY|He could have said: "Thank you, I like it too" and put it back in his pocket.
Setting: Florida, evening, condo of Jerry's parents|HELEN|He loves that pen.
Setting: Florida, evening, condo of Jerry's parents|MORTY|Oh come on!
Setting: Florida, evening, condo of Jerry's parents|HELEN|He talks about it all the time. Every time he takes it out he goes on and on about how it writes upside down, how the astronauts use it.
Setting: Florida, evening, condo of Jerry's parents|JERRY|If he likes it so much, he never should have offered it.
Setting: Florida, evening, condo of Jerry's parents|HELEN|He didn't think you'd accpet.
Setting: Florida, evening, condo of Jerry's parents|JERRY|Well, he was wrong.
Setting: Florida, evening, condo of Jerry's parents|HELEN|I know his wife. She has some mouth on her. She'll tell everyone in the condo now that you made him give you the pen. They're talking about it right now. (again we see Elaine smiling at their argument)
Setting: Florida, evening, condo of Jerry's parents|JERRY|So you want me to return it?
Setting: Florida, evening, condo of Jerry's parents|HELEN|Yes.
Setting: Florida, evening, condo of Jerry's parents|MORTY|He's not gonna return the pen. That's ridiculous.
Setting: Florida, evening, condo of Jerry's parents|JERRY|Hey I don't even want the pen now!
Setting: Florida, evening, condo of Jerry's parents|MORTY|Jack can afford to give away a pen with all his money. Believe me. He gives me a check for 19.45. He didn't have a Coke. Ho, ho, ho!

setting: still the condo, later|MORTY|You didn't give it to him.
setting: still the condo, later|JACK|What are you talking about? He pratically begged me for it.
setting: still the condo, later|MORTY|Where do you come off with this crap?
setting: still the condo, later|JACK|Listen, do you think I take everything everybody offers me? You offered me sponge cake yesterday. Did I take it?
setting: still the condo, later|MORTY|You said you didn't want it!
setting: still the condo, later|JACK|Of course I wanted it! I love sponge cake!
setting: still the condo, later|MORTY|Then who the hell said you couldn't have any? I mean what the hell do I care whether you have sponge cake?
setting: still the condo, later|action|Jerry and Elaine can't beleive what they're hearing
setting: still the condo, later|JACK|Because I saw the look on your face last week when I took the scotch tape!
setting: still the condo, later|MORTY|Ahh! Ahh! So YOU got the scotch tape! I've been looking all over for it!
setting: still the condo, later|JACK|Don't worry about it! I'll give it back!
setting: still the condo, later|MORTY|I don't want it!
setting: still the condo, later|JACK|I don't want it!
setting: still the condo, later|MORTY|You know Jack, do me a favor will you? Take the pen and the scotch tape, and get the hell out of here!
setting: still the condo, later|JACK|Listen do you think I give a damn?
setting: still the condo, later|MORTY|Aah! (Jack leaves) The nerve of that guy! Taking back that pen. Well that's it for them.
setting: still the condo, later|JERRY|What is going on in this community! Are you people aware of what's happening? What is driving you to this behavior? Is it the humudity? Is it the Muzak? Is it the white shoes?
setting: still the condo, later|HELEN|I have no use for either one of them. I don't even want them there tonight. (she still has the pocketbook in her hands)
setting: still the condo, later|JERRY|Isn't he supposed to be the emcee?
setting: still the condo, later|MORTY|yeah, he's supposed to be the emcee.
setting: still the condo, later|JERRY|Well. This should be a very interesting evening.
setting: still the condo, later|ELAINE|(still on the floor) Uh... What about those muscle relaxers?

setting: reception room, evening|action|Morty, Helen, Elaine and Jerry are standing for a photograph in the entrance. Jerry wears sunglasses and Elaine is all drugged-up on muscle relaxers.
setting: reception room, evening|PHOTOGRAPHER|Say astronaut.
setting: reception room, evening|action|Elaine is laughing for nothing and she walks right up to the lens of the camera.
setting: reception room, evening|ELAINE|Say what? (laughing) Say what?
setting: reception room, evening|JERRY|(Jerry brings her back) You took too many of those pills.
setting: reception room, evening|MORTY|Astronaut?
setting: reception room, evening|HELEN|Say it.
setting: reception room, evening|ELAINE|(still laughing, she says it just as the picture is taking) Astro...naut!
setting: reception room, evening|action|the image frozes and we see that the picture is awful, with Jerry and his sunglasses, and Elaine laughing who can barely stand.
setting: reception room, evening|MORTY|Good. O.K. (the photographer walks away) What about last year when I took him to the hospital every day? Did he ever say thank you?
setting: reception room, evening|JERRY|Oh God. (foreseeing an arm's grabbing as he sees Uncle Leo entering with his wife Stella)
setting: reception room, evening|JERRY|(to Leo) Uncle Leo.
setting: reception room, evening|LEO|Hello!
setting: reception room, evening|STELLA|Morty are you nervous?
setting: reception room, evening|MORTY|What nervous?
setting: reception room, evening|LEO|(to Jerry while he's grabbing his arm as usual) What's with the sunglasses? Who are you? Van Johnson?
setting: reception room, evening|JERRY|I've got a black eye.
setting: reception room, evening|STELLA|(to Elaine in a childish voice) Hello.
setting: reception room, evening|JERRY|Oh uh, Elaine, this is my aunt Stella.
setting: reception room, evening|HELEN|(shouting as she imitates Marlon Brando) STELLA! STELLA!
setting: reception room, evening|JERRY|(to Stella) Her back hurts.
setting: reception room, evening|STELLA|Humm... We saw you on "The Tonight Show" last week.
setting: reception room, evening|LEO|I thought Johnny was very rude to you. He didn't even let you talk.
setting: reception room, evening|JERRY|No, no.
setting: reception room, evening|LEO|You need some new material. I've heard you do that dog routine three times already.
setting: reception room, evening|ELAINE|(still with her imitation, shouting even louder) STELLA! STELLA!
setting: reception room, evening|LEO|Listen, you should get your cousin Jeffrey to write some material for you.
setting: reception room, evening|MORTY|What are you talking? Jeffrey works for the parks department!
setting: reception room, evening|LEO|You should read the letters he's written. He's funnier than the whole bunch of you! (Jack enters with Doris) Oh, here's Jack. We should sit down.
setting: reception room, evening|action|Jack and Morty exchange a look.
setting: reception room, evening|STELLA|(to Helen on a sarcastic tone of voice) This better be good. I'm missing "Golden Girls" for this.
setting: reception room, evening|HELEN|(laughing hypocritically till Stella walks away) I hate her like poison.
setting: reception room, evening|action|a few minutes later, the ceremony is about to begin. Someone in the crowd yells: "Hey Jack let's get started!" Everyone applause and we see, from left to right, all sitting on the same side of a long table, facing the public: Stella, Leo, Elaine, Jerry, Helen, Morty, Jack at the microphone, Doris, and four other people.
setting: reception room, evening|JACK|(on the microphone) Ladies and gentlemen, as you know, every year, Phase Two of the Pines of Mark Gables honors the previous year president. And this year we are honoring Morty Seinfeld (the crowd applause and someone yells: Morty!) A man who slept more hours on the job than Ronald Reagan.
setting: reception room, evening|MORTY|(to Helen) Slept on the job? (she shushed him)
setting: reception room, evening|JACK|Being president of the condo is not easy. It requires hard work, dedication, and commitment, and unfortunately he possesses none of these qualities. (everyone laugh except Jerry, Helen, and Morty. Even Elaine who's still druggy)
setting: reception room, evening|HELEN|(Morty complains again to Helen) He's joking.
setting: reception room, evening|JACK|His administration did excel in one department: the hiring of incompetents.
setting: reception room, evening|MORTY|(to Jack, loud) That's what you say.
setting: reception room, evening|JACK|But we do owe him a debt of gratitude because by not fixing the crack in the sidewalk, he put Mrs Ziven out of commission for a few weeks. (Morty is now the only one not laughing)
setting: reception room, evening|MORTY|(loud) Tell them when you took my son's pen back. Tell them about that! (he gets up)
setting: reception room, evening|JERRY|Dad!
setting: reception room, evening|MORTY|(to the crowd) He gave my son a pen, and then he takes it back. Tell them about that!
setting: reception room, evening|JACK|He gave it to me!
setting: reception room, evening|MORTY|Come on. That's enough, sit down!
setting: reception room, evening|JACK|I'm not sitting down!
setting: reception room, evening|action|they start to fight. Morty tries to get the microphone off Jack' hands. He yells to Jack to give him the pen. Jerry gets up and tries to separate them. We hear a feedback from the microphone and they stop to fight
setting: reception room, evening|JACK|Ow! You broke my dental plate! (Jack is touching his dental plate while Morty reaches in Jack's pocket to get the pen) Doris! He broke my dental plate. You son-of-a-bitch! I'm gonna sue you. (he leaves the table and Morty follows him and continue arguing with him. Jerry now have the microphone in his hands and the crowd begins to think the ceremony is over.)
setting: reception room, evening|HELEN|Jerry, do your act.
setting: reception room, evening|JERRY|(in the microphone, but to Helen) I can't. Nobody's even listening.
setting: reception room, evening|HELEN|They're all gonna leave.
setting: reception room, evening|JERRY|(to himself) Oh God! (in the microphone) huh... Hey! How you folks doing tonight? (everybody in the crowd is talking over Jerry)
setting: reception room, evening|JERRY|(still with his sunglasses) Have you ever noticed how they always give you the peanuts on the planes?
setting: reception room, evening|action|Elaine is almost asleep at the table
setting: reception room, evening|JERRY|Who ever thought the first thing somebody wants on a plane is a peanut?
setting: reception room, evening|HELEN|(to Jerry) Do the dog routine.
setting: reception room, evening|JERRY|All I said was I liked the pen!
setting: reception room, evening|ELAINE|(wakes up and yells very loud) STELLA!

setting: condo, morning|CHIROPRACTOR|You could aggravate it. I wouldn't go anywhere for at least five days.
setting: condo, morning|ELAINE|Five days? You want me to stay here for five more days?
setting: condo, morning|JERRY|There must be some mistake.
setting: condo, morning|CHIROPRACTOR|I'm afraid not.
setting: condo, morning|ELAINE|(discouraged) Five days. Here.
setting: condo, morning|HELEN|(to Jerry, happily) So we have you for five more days!
setting: condo, morning|JERRY|(to Elaine) Well there's really no point in me staying. I mean you just gonna be...
setting: condo, morning|ELAINE|Excuse me?
setting: condo, morning|JERRY|Nothing.
setting: condo, morning|action|Evelyn enters
setting: condo, morning|EVELYN|Good morning.
setting: condo, morning|JERRY|Hi Evelyn.
setting: condo, morning|EVELYN|(to Helen) Has Morty decided on a lawyer yet?
setting: condo, morning|HELEN|I don't think so.
setting: condo, morning|EVELYN|Because my nephew Larry could do it. He's a brilliant lawyer. He says Jack has no case.
setting: condo, morning|HELEN|Well I'll ask him when he gets up.
setting: condo, morning|EVELYN|Oh, and I spoke to Arnold. And he says that according to the bylaws of the condo constitution, they need six votes to throw you out for unruly behavior. Not five. Doctor Chernov is the one you'll have to suck up to.
setting: condo, morning|action|Morty gets up in a bad shape
setting: condo, morning|MORTY|Aw! Aw! Oh my back! Oh my back! It's that bar. Who the hell could sleep on that thing?
setting: condo, morning|HELEN|I was very comfortable.
setting: condo, morning|EVELYN|Morty, Arnold says they need six votes to throw you out.
setting: condo, morning|HELEN|It's in the constitution.
setting: condo, morning|MORTY|(to the chiro) Who are you?
setting: condo, morning|CHIROPRACTOR|I'm a chiropractor.
setting: condo, morning|MORTY|What are you kidding me?
setting: condo, morning|ELAINE|(to Jerry) Five more days?
setting: condo, morning|JERRY|Well today's almost over. And weekdays always go by fast. Friday we're leaving. It's like two days really. It's like a cup of coffee. It will go by like that. (snapping his fingers)
setting: condo, morning|action|scene ends
setting: night club, closing monologue|JERRY|Is Florida not hot and muggy enough for these people? They love heat. I mean if they ever decide to land men on the sun, I think these old retired guys would be the only ones that will be able to handle it. They'll just sit there on the sun, on the redwood benches, washcloth on the head going: "Close the door, you're letting all the heat off the sun. I'm trying to get a sweat going."
