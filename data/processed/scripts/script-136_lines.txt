George at a meeting at the Susan Ross Foundation.|GEORGE|You want me to find a poem about Susan? May she rest in peace?!
George at a meeting at the Susan Ross Foundation.|WYCK|Well, we think it would be a nice touch for the Foundation literature. Do you have a favorite poet, George?
George at a meeting at the Susan Ross Foundation.|GEORGE|I like, uh...(mutters something unintelligible under his breath.)
George at a meeting at the Susan Ross Foundation.|WYCK|Pardon?
George at a meeting at the Susan Ross Foundation.|GEORGE|(mutters it again)
George at a meeting at the Susan Ross Foundation.|WYCK|Well, you should choose the poem since you knew Susan best at the time of her unfortunate (clears his throat)...accident.
George at a meeting at the Susan Ross Foundation.|action|George looks at Wyck suspiciously.
George and Jerry at the coffee shop later that day.|JERRY|He cleared his throat?
George and Jerry at the coffee shop later that day.|GEORGE|Yes!
George and Jerry at the coffee shop later that day.|JERRY|So?
George and Jerry at the coffee shop later that day.|GEORGE|He did it right as he said "her unfortunate accident."
George and Jerry at the coffee shop later that day.|JERRY|Not getting it.
George and Jerry at the coffee shop later that day.|GEORGE|Jerry, a throat-clear is a non-verbal implication of doubt - he thinks I killed Susan!
George and Jerry at the coffee shop later that day.|JERRY|Oh, help me, Rhonda.
George and Jerry at the coffee shop later that day.|GEORGE|What time is it?
George and Jerry at the coffee shop later that day.|GEORGE|Right now?
George and Jerry at the coffee shop later that day.|JERRY|I gotta go meet Pam.
George and Jerry at the coffee shop later that day.|GEORGE|Oh, the bookstore girl. How's that goin'?
George and Jerry at the coffee shop later that day.|JERRY|Okay. I'm just not ga-ga over her. For once I'd like to be ga-ga.
George and Jerry at the coffee shop later that day.|GEORGE|Where's Elaine?
George and Jerry at the coffee shop later that day.|JERRY|She's having Carol, Gail and Lisa over. You know they all have kids now?
George and Jerry at the coffee shop later that day.|GEORGE|What's with all these people having babies?
George and Jerry at the coffee shop later that day.|JERRY|Perpetuation of the species.
George and Jerry at the coffee shop later that day.|GEORGE|Yeah! Right!
George and Jerry at the coffee shop later that day.|JERRY|By the way, just for the record -
George and Jerry at the coffee shop later that day.|GEORGE|No, I did not! (They exit the coffee shop.)
Elaine at her apartment with Carol, Gail and Lisa.|CAROL|...but because it comes out of your baby, it smells good!
Elaine at her apartment with Carol, Gail and Lisa.|ELAINE|Well, that's...that's sweet.
Elaine at her apartment with Carol, Gail and Lisa.|GAIL|Being a mother has made me feel so beautiful.
Elaine at her apartment with Carol, Gail and Lisa.|CAROL|Elaine, you gotta have a baby!
Elaine at her apartment with Carol, Gail and Lisa.|ELAINE|Oh, hey, you know...I had a piece of whitefish over at Barney Greengrass the other day...
Elaine at her apartment with Carol, Gail and Lisa.|LISA|Elaine. Move to Long Island and have a baby already.
Elaine at her apartment with Carol, Gail and Lisa.|ELAINE|I really like the city.
Elaine at her apartment with Carol, Gail and Lisa.|CAROL|The city's a toilet. When's the last time you saw my little Adam?
Elaine at her apartment with Carol, Gail and Lisa.|ELAINE|Uh, it was in the Hamptons.
Elaine at her apartment with Carol, Gail and Lisa.|CAROL|Oh! I have pictures!
Elaine at her apartment with Carol, Gail and Lisa.|ELAINE|No, no, that's okay, it's uh...
Elaine at her apartment with Carol, Gail and Lisa.|action|Elaine is revolted by the sight of "breathtaking" little Adam.
Jerry and George walking down the street after leaving Monk's.|JERRY|So, Elaine was telling me about this piece of whitefish she had the other day...
Jerry and George walking down the street after leaving Monk's.|GEORGE|Do you really think I'm wrong about this Wyck guy?
Jerry and George walking down the street after leaving Monk's.|JERRY|You know, if you really want to test him out, why don't you try the old Jerry Lewis trick?
Jerry and George walking down the street after leaving Monk's.|GEORGE|Jerry Lewis?
Jerry and George walking down the street after leaving Monk's.|JERRY|I heard that when Jerry Lewis left a meeting, he'd purposefully leave a briefcase with a tape recorder in it. Then after five minutes, he'd come back for it and listen to what everyone said about him.
Jerry and George walking down the street after leaving Monk's.|GEORGE|That's pretty paranoid.
Jerry and George walking down the street after leaving Monk's.|JERRY|Yes, it is.
Jerry and George walking down the street after leaving Monk's.|GEORGE|I like it!
Jerry and George walking down the street after leaving Monk's.|JERRY|I thought you might.
Kramer in Jerry's apartment. Pam enters.|PAM|Oh, hi! I'm Pam. You must be Kramer. (Kramer is smitten with Pam and grins goofily.) Jerry's told me a lot about you. (Kramer continues grinning.) Well, I'm supposed to meet Jerry, it's my day off. I work in a bookstore.
Kramer in Jerry's apartment. Pam enters.|PAM|Oh, careful! (Jerry enters.)
Kramer in Jerry's apartment. Pam enters.|JERRY|Hi, sorry I'm late.
Kramer in Jerry's apartment. Pam enters.|PAM|That's okay. Kramer let me in.
Kramer in Jerry's apartment. Pam enters.|JERRY|You know, if we rush, we can still make the movie.
Kramer in Jerry's apartment. Pam enters.|PAM|Okay. (Touches Kramer's hand) It was really nice meeting you.
Kramer in Jerry's apartment. Pam enters.|action|Jerry and Pam leave. Kramer sniffs his hand where Pam touched him, and makes a delighted noise.
Kramer and Newman in Newman's apartment.|KRAMER|I'm in trouble, buddy. I just met a woman.
Kramer and Newman in Newman's apartment.|NEWMAN|Go on.
Kramer and Newman in Newman's apartment.|KRAMER|Well, she's Jerry's girlfriend.
Kramer and Newman in Newman's apartment.|NEWMAN|Ah, yes. Forbidden love.
Kramer and Newman in Newman's apartment.|KRAMER|She works in a book shop. Her name is Pam.
Kramer and Newman in Newman's apartment.|NEWMAN|"Pam." I don't know the woman, but she sounds quite fetching.
Kramer and Newman in Newman's apartment.|KRAMER|I can't even speak in front of her. (Sits down on the couch.)
Kramer and Newman in Newman's apartment.|NEWMAN|Jerry! What could she possibly see in Jerry? (Walks in front of Kramer and trips over his feet.)
Kramer and Newman in Newman's apartment.|KRAMER|She has delicate beauty.
Kramer and Newman in Newman's apartment.|NEWMAN|Jerry wouldn't know delicate beauty if it bludgeoned him over the head.
Kramer and Newman in Newman's apartment.|KRAMER|And yet, he's my friend.
Kramer and Newman in Newman's apartment.|NEWMAN|And therein lies the tragedy. For I believe, sadly for you, that there is but one woman meant for each of us. One perfect angel for whom we are put on this earth.
Kramer and Newman in Newman's apartment.|KRAMER|Aw, that's beautiful, Newman.
Kramer and Newman in Newman's apartment.|NEWMAN|One winsome tulip we ceaselessly yearn for throughout our dreary, workaday lives! And you, my friend, have found your angel. I can tell. For my heart has also been captured by a breathless beauty - whom I fear I will never possess.
Kramer and Newman in Newman's apartment.|KRAMER|I thought we were talking about me.
Kramer and Newman in Newman's apartment.|NEWMAN|Right. Kramer, you have to confront Jerry.
Kramer and Newman in Newman's apartment.|KRAMER|Confront Jerry? I can't.
Kramer and Newman in Newman's apartment.|NEWMAN|You must!
Kramer and Newman in Newman's apartment.|KRAMER|I won't!
Kramer and Newman in Newman's apartment.|NEWMAN|You will!
Jerry, Elaine and George at a newsstand.|GEORGE|Where are all the poetry magazines?
Jerry, Elaine and George at a newsstand.|ELAINE|The New Yorker has poetry.
Jerry, Elaine and George at a newsstand.|GEORGE|Yes. The New Yorker.
Jerry, Elaine and George at a newsstand.|JERRY|Why do you invite these women over if they annoy you so much?
Jerry, Elaine and George at a newsstand.|ELAINE|They're my friends, but they act as if having a baby takes some kind of talent.
Jerry, Elaine and George at a newsstand.|JERRY|C'mon, you want to have a baby.
Jerry, Elaine and George at a newsstand.|ELAINE|Why? Because I can?
Jerry, Elaine and George at a newsstand.|JERRY|It's the life force. I saw a show on the mollusk last night. Elaine, the mollusk travels from Alaska to Chile just for a shot at another mollusk. You think you're any better?
Jerry, Elaine and George at a newsstand.|ELAINE|Yes! I think I am better than the mollusk!
Jerry, Elaine and George at a newsstand.|KEVIN|I couldn't help overhearing what you were saying.
Jerry, Elaine and George at a newsstand.|ELAINE|Oh, I'm sorry.
Jerry, Elaine and George at a newsstand.|KEVIN|No, no, I think I agree with you. I mean, all this talk about having babies.
Jerry, Elaine and George at a newsstand.|ELAINE|Yeah, like you must procreate.
Jerry, Elaine and George at a newsstand.|KEVIN|Besides, anyone can do it.
Jerry, Elaine and George at a newsstand.|ELAINE|Oh, it's been done to death. (smiles)
George in another meeting at the Foundation. He has a briefcase with a tape recorder in it.|GEORGE|I, uh, should have a poem very soon now.
George in another meeting at the Foundation. He has a briefcase with a tape recorder in it.|WYCK|Are you okay, George?
George in another meeting at the Foundation. He has a briefcase with a tape recorder in it.|GEORGE|No, no, not really. Ever since Susan passed on, I have good days and bad. (Turns the briefcase towards the woman on his left.) Some days, I'm haunted by one word - why. Why Susan? Why wasn't it me licking those invitations? Why am I still here? Well, I gotta run.

Elaine and Kevin at the coffee shop.|ELAINE|So, Kevin. If I don't want children, does that make me a bad humanitarian?
Elaine and Kevin at the coffee shop.|KEVIN|Not at all.
Elaine and Kevin at the coffee shop.|ELAINE|'Cause, I mean, when you get to know me, you'll see that I'm a pretty good humanitarian. (Waitress comes to the table and pours more coffee.) You are doing a wonderful job, by the way. Thanks a lot. (To Kevin) Right? Am I right? (Kramer walks by.) Kramer. Kramer! Come here, look at my new friend Kevin. (Kramer and Kevin shake hands.) Oh, you got a little, uh...
Elaine and Kevin at the coffee shop.|ELAINE|Oh. Are you alright?
Elaine and Kevin at the coffee shop.|KRAMER|Yeah, I'll be okay.
Elaine and Kevin at the coffee shop.|ELAINE|You know, Jerry has one of those every time he bombs on stage.

George shows up at Jerry's apartment later that night with the briefcase.|GEORGE|Lemme tell you something, that Jerry Lewis? You wonder how some of these people get to the top? It's ideas like this! Brilliant! Hah-hah! (Notices that the briefcase is damaged.) Look at this - what the hell happened? The whole side is damaged here...and the lock is broken.
George shows up at Jerry's apartment later that night with the briefcase.|JERRY|How long did you leave it up there?
George shows up at Jerry's apartment later that night with the briefcase.|GEORGE|Five minutes. What the hell happened here?

Elaine and George at the coffee shop listening to the briefcase tape.|GEORGE|It's baffling, isn't it?
Elaine and George at the coffee shop listening to the briefcase tape.|ELAINE|Well, one question does come to mind. Have you considered just...asking them what happened to the briefcase?

Kramer and Newman in an aisle at the bookstore where Pam works.|NEWMAN|Shell.
Kramer and Newman in an aisle at the bookstore where Pam works.|KRAMER|...shell. And fondled his muscled heart. He embibed her glistening spell...just before the other shoe...fell.
