Setting: Night club|JERRY|Thank you! Goodnight! (Walks off stage, sighing deeply. Instantly, a red-headed woman runs up and hugs him - taking Jerry by surprise)
Setting: Night club|SALLY|Jerry!
Setting: Night club|JERRY|(Trying to ward her off) Hey. Hey!
Setting: Night club|SALLY|(Reminding him who she is) Sally Weaver! (Sees Jerry's expression - he still has no clue who she is) Susan Ross' roommate from college.. hello! (Laughs slightly)
Setting: Night club|JERRY|Right.. Oh, I'm sorry. Uh, oh, so you saw the show?
Setting: Night club|SALLY|Saw it? I loved it! And thank you for the free tickets. You are so funny.
Setting: Night club|JERRY|(Modest) Oh, thanks.
Setting: Night club|SALLY|(Serious) No, no, I mean it. You're very funny.
Setting: Night club|JERRY|(Blunt) I believe you.
Setting: Night club|SALLY|Oh, anyway, let me show you Memphis. I am taking you (Points to him) out to dinner.
Setting: Night club|JERRY|(Grabbing his coat) Oh, I'm sorry, I can't - I'm going straight to the airport.
Setting: Night club|SALLY|Ohh.. that's too bad.. Susan thought we'd really get along - I guess because we're both wacko! (Jerry laughs) You know what, um.. (Turns around, picking up a large gift from a table) You have to give this to them for me. Okay? Here. (Hands the box to Jerry, he struggles under the size of it) It's a wedding present.
Setting: Night club|JERRY|Oh?
Setting: Night club|SALLY|And Jerry? Be careful with it, okay? Be very careful.
Setting: Night club|JERRY|Uh-huh.

Setting: The Coffee shop|FRANK|George, as you may be aware, your mother and I are not moving to Del Boca Vista, Florida.
Setting: The Coffee shop|GEORGE|(Resenting the fact. Nodding) I am aware.
Setting: The Coffee shop|FRANK|So, I was wondering, would it be okay if I turned your room into a billiard parlor?
Setting: The Coffee shop|GEORGE|A billiard parlor?
Setting: The Coffee shop|FRANK|Regulation table, the hi-fi, maybe even a bar.. Give it real authenticity..
Setting: The Coffee shop|action|Elaine enters. George spots her in mid-sentence
Setting: The Coffee shop|GEORGE|Well, that's.. Elaine!
Setting: The Coffee shop|ELAINE|Oh, hi, Frank.
Setting: The Coffee shop|GEORGE|(Sliding over to make room for her) Sit down. Join us, please.
Setting: The Coffee shop|ELAINE|(Trying to come up with an excuse not to sit with them) Actually, I gotta get to the.. uh.. thing.
Setting: The Coffee shop|GEORGE|(Somewhat stern) Oh, the thing's cancelled. Sit down.
Setting: The Coffee shop|ELAINE|(Giving up) Okay.. (Sits, George laughs) So.. (Trying to think up something to talk about) Frank, did George ever show you that photo?
Setting: The Coffee shop|GEORGE|(Confused) What photo?
Setting: The Coffee shop|ELAINE|You know, the photo I took in Tuscany of the little man in front of the sign that said "Costanza"?
Setting: The Coffee shop|FRANK|(Interested) There's a Costanza in Tuscany? (Elaine nods) Did he look like me? Did you talk to him?
Setting: The Coffee shop|ELAINE|I didn't talk to anyone - I was just walking by, and I saw the sign, and I thought George might get a kick out of it.
Setting: The Coffee shop|FRANK|I gotta get that picture - it could be my cousin, Carlo.
Setting: The Coffee shop|ELAINE|Who is that?
Setting: The Coffee shop|GEORGE|(Muttering out, not really wanting to talk about his family) When the Costanzas came here, one brother stayed behind.
Setting: The Coffee shop|FRANK|I played with him every day until the age of four - and then we separated.
Setting: The Coffee shop|ELAINE|So, you weren't born here?
Setting: The Coffee shop|FRANK|No. That's why I can never be president.. It always irked me. That's why, even at an early age, I had no interest in politics. I refuse to vote. (Yelling out) They don't want me, I don't want them!
Setting: The Coffee shop|GEORGE|I don't know what you're getting all riled up about. There are probably a million Costanzas-
Setting: The Coffee shop|FRANK|(Cutting him off) Don't bring me down. (To Elaine) Do you have another copy of that photo?
Setting: The Coffee shop|ELAINE|No, I, I don't. But.. Well, the Maestro might.
Setting: The Coffee shop|FRANK|The Maestro? What Maestro?
Setting: The Coffee shop|ELAINE|He's this guy that I went to Tuscany with. He's a great guy, but I just wouldn't feel comfortable calling him.
Setting: The Coffee shop|GEORGE|Really? Why?
Setting: The Coffee shop|ELAINE|(Explaining) Because he hasn't called me since we got back.. I spilled wine on his 8 by 10 photo of one of his favorite Italian opera stars.
Setting: The Coffee shop|GEORGE|Who?
Setting: The Coffee shop|ELAINE|You know the Three Tenors?
Setting: The Coffee shop|GEORGE|Yeah.. (Trying to remember) Poverotti.. Domingo.. and.. uh.. the other guy.

Setting: Airplane|JERRY|Uh.. well, you better not. I'm supposed to be careful with it.
Setting: Airplane|STEWARDESS|Oh, then, I'll have to put your bag in the over-head.
Setting: Airplane|JERRY|Oh, okay..
Setting: Airplane|action|The stewardess takes the bag, and crams it into the over-head compartment. The sound of glass breaking can be heard

Setting: Jerry's apartment|JERRY|Ohh.. look at this..
Setting: Jerry's apartment|KRAMER|What?
Setting: Jerry's apartment|JERRY|I bought a bottle of BBQ sauce in Memphis. I think the stewardess broke it when she tried to jam it into the overhead compartment because of this
Setting: Jerry's apartment|KRAMER|Well, don't press the panic button. I'm sure that we can still salvage some sauce..
Setting: Jerry's apartment|JERRY|I don't care about the sauce. It came in this funny little bottle, and there was a guy on the label that looked exactly like Charles Grodin.
Setting: Jerry's apartment|KRAMER|(Taking some of Jerry's clothing over to the kitchen) I see..
Setting: Jerry's apartment|JERRY|No, you don't see - because I'm going on the show this week, and this was going to be my bit on the show.
Setting: Jerry's apartment|KRAMER|Well, why don't you do your material?
Setting: Jerry's apartment|JERRY|I'm out.

Setting: Jerry's apartment|GEORGE|Hey, buddies.
Setting: Jerry's apartment|JERRY|Hey. Hey, this is for you. (Taps the gift) It's from.. uh, Susan's roommate, Sally.
Setting: Jerry's apartment|GEORGE|Oh yeah.. (Starts to open it) Sally called Susan - said you guys really hit it off.
Setting: Jerry's apartment|JERRY|(Annoyed at the thought) Nobody hit anything off. She just gave me the box. (Looks over at Kramer. He is scraping the BBQ sauce off Jerry's clothes with a knife, then dipping some bread into it) What the hell are you doing?
Setting: Jerry's apartment|KRAMER|(Looks up) I'm salvaging the sauce. What's the matter with you? (Eats the bread)
Setting: Jerry's apartment|action|George is still opening the gift - flinging Styrofoam peanuts all over the table
Setting: Jerry's apartment|JERRY|(Pleading) Hey, hey, hey. Come on, come on.
Setting: Jerry's apartment|KRAMER|(Moving out into the living room) Jerry, why don't you do a bit on Styrofoam?
Setting: Jerry's apartment|JERRY|Like what?
Setting: Jerry's apartment|KRAMER|Well, uh.. (Starts to impersonate Jerry's act) "What is this stuff? Why do we need this stuff?.. And why do they make it so small..?"
Setting: Jerry's apartment|JERRY|(Confused) Where's the punchline?
Setting: Jerry's apartment|KRAMER|It's all attitude.. (Makes a humorous face - mocking Jerry's)
Setting: Jerry's apartment|GOERGE|(Taking out a mat from the huge box) Well, this is certainly a crappy gift..
Setting: Jerry's apartment|JERRY|A door mat? That's what she had me lug up from Memphis?!
Setting: Jerry's apartment|GEORGE|Pretty chintzy, huh? Considering the money she makes.. She's a big executive for Federal Express.
Setting: Jerry's apartment|JERRY|Federal Express?! Is she out of her mind? Why didn't she just ship it?!
Setting: Jerry's apartment|KRAMER|Look, it's personalized. (Holds it up, reading) "The Costanzas"
Setting: Jerry's apartment|GEORGE|No, no. Forget it. I don't want it. Let's just get rid of it.
Setting: Jerry's apartment|KRAMER|Well, maybe your father would be interested in that.
Setting: Jerry's apartment|GEORGE|I doubt it. You know what he's doing now? He's putting a pool table in my old bedroom.
Setting: Jerry's apartment|KRAMER|(Interested) Oh yeah? Well, maybe I'll go out there and knock a few balls around with him. You know, show him a thing or two..

Setting: George and Susan's apartment|GEORGE|Oh my God! What is that?!
Setting: George and Susan's apartment|SUSAN|(Rushing in) What? What is it?
Setting: George and Susan's apartment|GEORGE|(Staring at the doll) This doll (Pointing) looks like my mother.
Setting: George and Susan's apartment|SUSAN|George, it's a doll.
Setting: George and Susan's apartment|GEORGE|I know it's a doll, but it looks like my mother!

Setting: George's old bedroom|FRANK|We still haven't finished the first game.
Setting: George's old bedroom|ESTELLE|The first game?!
Setting: George's old bedroom|KRAMER|(Explaining why they are doing so bad) Well, we're still, uh, learning the subtleties of the table.
Setting: George's old bedroom|FRANK|(To Estelle) he knows the Maestro. He could have the picture..
Setting: George's old bedroom|ESTELLE|Oh, forget about it. It's not your cousin.

Setting: Jerry's apartment|JERRY|Oh, it's unbelievable. Every time you use it you feel like you just came from the dentist!

Setting: Jerry's apartment|ELAINE|Who else is on the show?
Setting: Jerry's apartment|JERRY|Uh.. one of the three tenors.
Setting: Jerry's apartment|ELAINE|(Interested) The Three Tenors? (Stands up) Which one?!
Setting: Jerry's apartment|JERRY|Uh.. It's not Poverotti.. It's not Domingo..
Setting: Jerry's apartment|ELAINE|(Extremely excited) The other guy?!
Setting: Jerry's apartment|JERRY|(Nodding) Yeah, the other guy.
Setting: Jerry's apartment|ELAINE|(Screams out in joy) My God! I can't believe the other guy's going to be on the show!
Setting: Jerry's apartment|JERRY|Why?
Setting: Jerry's apartment|ELAINE|Because I ruined this autographed picture of him that belonged to the Maestro. You think I can go and get his autograph?

Setting: Jerry's apartment|GEORGE|I don't. Susan wants to have it out when Sally comes tomorrow.
Setting: Jerry's apartment|JERRY|Sally? (Getting upset) Wait, wait a minute - She's coming to New York?
Setting: Jerry's apartment|GEORGE|Yeah, (Smiling) Susan said you'd be excited.
Setting: Jerry's apartment|JERRY|Excited? I'm gonna kill her! She knew she was coming here and she made me carry that box?!
Setting: Jerry's apartment|ELAINE|Who's Sally?
Setting: Jerry's apartment|GEORGE|Susan's college roommate.
Setting: Jerry's apartment|JERRY|It's because of her that bottle got broke that I was going to give to Charles Grodin on his show.
Setting: Jerry's apartment|GEORGE|So call her up and tell her to bring you another one. She'll be delighted to talk to you.
Setting: Jerry's apartment|JERRY|(While opening a cereal box) I will - don't worry. (Plotting revenge) In fact, I'll have her bring up a whole case of the stuff. It'll be really heavy. Let's see if she likes sitting on a plane with a big box on her lap!
Setting: Jerry's apartment|ELAINE|That's sounds pretty juvenile.

Setting: The Maestro's Office|KRAMER|Well, listen, if you bring 'em by, maybe we could interest you in a game of pool.. Yeah, Frank here - he's got his own billiard room.
Setting: The Maestro's Office|FRANK|(Trying to concentrate) Yes, It's, uh, it's.. uh, uh.. What do you call it, Kramer?
Setting: The Maestro's Office|KRAMER|A billiard room.
Setting: The Maestro's Office|FRANK|No, not billiard.. (Scolding) Not billiards.. it was.. Come on, already. Come on..

Setting: Jerry's apartment|GEORGE|Jerry, come on. If my mother keeps shrinking, this is exactly what she's gonna look like in ten years!
Setting: Jerry's apartment|JERRY|Why don't you just get rid of it?
Setting: Jerry's apartment|GEORGE|I tried! I almost threw it down the incinerator, but I couldn't do it. The guilt was too overwhelming. (Grabs the doll, opening the door to leave) Susan's so attached to this thing.
Setting: Jerry's apartment|JERRY|Wait, where are you going? Don't take your dolly and go home.

Setting: Jerry's apartment|JERRY|Oh, did you bring the bar-b-que sauce?
Setting: Jerry's apartment|SALLY|A whole case.
Setting: Jerry's apartment|JERRY|(Letting her up) Excellent. (To Elaine) So, did you buy that electric toothbrush I was telling you about?
Setting: Jerry's apartment|ELAINE|(Blunt, to the point) No.
Setting: Jerry's apartment|JERRY|How come? I told you - It's fantastic.
Setting: Jerry's apartment|ELAINE|Eh, I like mine.
Setting: Jerry's apartment|JERRY|I've had yours, I'm telling you - this one is ten times better. Don't you believe me?
Setting: Jerry's apartment|ELAINE|I don't want it.
Setting: Jerry's apartment|JERRY|(Slightly confused by her behavior) I don't understand this. Why wouldn't you want to get something that's better if I'm telling you it's better? And it's not a little better - it's much better.
Setting: Jerry's apartment|ELAINE|(Not committing to the conversation) It doesn't matter to me.

Setting: Jerry's apartment|ELAINE|Hi.
Setting: Jerry's apartment|JERRY|How was your flight? (Wishful thinking) Pretty uncomfortable?
Setting: Jerry's apartment|SALLY|(Setting the box down on his table) Actually, the seat next to me was empty, so, there was no problem at all.
Setting: Jerry's apartment|JERRY|(Let down) Oh.. (Starts to open the box) Oh, wait.. (Holding up one of the BBQ jars) This isn't the sauce that I asked for!
Setting: Jerry's apartment|SALLY|That's right. It's a special gourmet sauce. "The Pride of Memphis!"
Setting: Jerry's apartment|JERRY|(Complaining) No, no. I wanted the one in the little bottle with that guy on it that looks like Charles Grodin!
Setting: Jerry's apartment|SALLY|This is much better. And frankly, in Memphis, we think that other sauce as (Whispering) kind of a joke.
Setting: Jerry's apartment|JERRY|I know it's a joke. It's supposed to be a joke! Now I'm going on the Charles Grodin Show with nothing. (Sets the jar down angrily) Nothing!
Setting: Jerry's apartment|SALLY|You could just do your material.

Setting: George's old bedroom|FRANK|(Complaining) I can't make anything..

Setting: Jerry's apartment|JERRY|Well, maybe if I didn't have so many people in my apartment all the time I'd be able to get some work done.
Setting: Jerry's apartment|ELAINE|(Getting the hint) Me? Are you talking about me?
Setting: Jerry's apartment|JERRY|(Deeply sarcastic) No. You're never here.
Setting: Jerry's apartment|ELAINE|(Reflecting) Boy, that doll was really freaky, wasn't it?
Setting: Jerry's apartment|JERRY|Yeah. Really. (Forming and idea) Hey, you know what? Maybe I could talk about that on the show.
Setting: Jerry's apartment|ELAINE|What?
Setting: Jerry's apartment|JERRY|Show the doll - show the picture of George's mother.. it's pretty funny. (Moving toward the phone) I'm gonna call them.

Setting: George's old bedroom|KRAMER|Yeah.. (Sizes up his next shot. His stick jams into the window as he draws back) See? This is no good.. (Looks around the room. His sights fall on the Maestro's baton) Hey, the baton. (Chalks it up) I got a hunch, fat man, I can't miss. (Measures up his shot) 13 in the side pocket. (Does just that) Giddy-up. (Moves around to the other side of the board, judging his next move) Six in the corner. (Hits it in) This table's mine. (A series of Kramer's plays are displayed, and, on the last ball of the game..) You know where it's going..

Setting: The Charles Grodin Show dressing room|ELAINE|Is George here?
Setting: The Charles Grodin Show dressing room|JERRY|Not yet. (Points over to a man sitting in one of the room's chairs. Whispers) The other guy.
Setting: The Charles Grodin Show dressing room|action|Elaine gasps. Smiling, she walks over to him
Setting: The Charles Grodin Show dressing room|ELAINE|It's.. .. you! It's really you! Oh, I'm such a huge fan of yours. Would you mind signing this poster for me?
Setting: The Charles Grodin Show dressing room|CARRERAS|My pleasure. (Reaches for a pen as Elaine unravels her poster)
Setting: The Charles Grodin Show dressing room|ELAINE|(As he is signing) Oh, thank you so much. (He finishes. Elaine gives out a happy gasp) Thank you so much, Mr.. (Tries to read his signature) Camaro. (Carreras gives her a look as he is getting up) Mr. Casea? (He walks off as Elaine rolls the picture back up. Jerry gives his "That's a shame" face) Well, whatever. (To Jerry) I'm gonna take this to the Maestro. He's, he's playing at the Queens Convalescent Center.
Setting: The Charles Grodin Show dressing room|JERRY|(Joking around) Well, that's one hell of a gig. (Turning around, he picks up a box labeled "Ori-dent") Hey, look, I got something for you. The Ori-dent!
Setting: The Charles Grodin Show dressing room|ELAINE|(Mock joy) Ohh.. thank you. (Accepts the gift) Huh.. (Struggles under the size) Wha-- why does a toothbrush come in such a big box?
Setting: The Charles Grodin Show dressing room|JERRY|Well, it's a delicate mechanism - It, you know, needs lots of packaging.
Setting: The Charles Grodin Show dressing room|ELAINE|(Still trying to get a grasp on the package) How am I supposed to carry this thing? (She looks up to see Jerry taking his pants off) What are you doing?
Setting: The Charles Grodin Show dressing room|JERRY|Well, I want to sit down.
Setting: The Charles Grodin Show dressing room|ELAINE|So?
Setting: The Charles Grodin Show dressing room|JERRY|It's a trick I just learned from Kramer. It keeps a crease in the pants. (Folds his pants over the head of a chair, then sits down in another. When he sees Elaine's staring at him, he makes a "Tada!" gesture with his hands. Elaine holds her hand up - as if to say "I'll see ya.", and while she's slowly walking out Jerry gives her a salute)

Setting: The Charles Grodin Show dressing room|JERRY|(Complaining) No! That's the wrong doll!
Setting: The Charles Grodin Show dressing room|SALLY|Jerry, I saw the doll you were talking about - not funny! This doll's much funnier. Look, it has a little bowtie, and a cute little hat.. I think it's a riot!
