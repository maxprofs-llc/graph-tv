Opening Monologue|JERRY|Whenever I see the news and they're hauling in some kind of terrorist, psycho, maniac, mass murderer guy. You notice he's always covering up his face with the newspaper, with the jacket, with the hat. What is he worried about? I mean what is this man's reputation? That he has to worry about this kind of exposure damaging his good name? I mean, what is he up for a big job promotion down at the office or something? Afraid the boss is gonna catch this on TV and go "isn't that Johnson from sales? He's up in that clock tower picking people off one by one. I don't know if that's that kind of man we want heading up that new branch office. He should be in bill collection. I think he's got aptitude."
Office complex; Levitan's office|LEVITAN|(on the phone) Ha ha, she was great. You don't want to know. Hey Breaky, remind me to tell you what we did in Lake George. (laughing) Get this...I got it all on video. (laughing)
Office complex; Levitan's office|action|George bursts into the office
Office complex; Levitan's office|GEORGE|That's it. This is it. I'm done. Through. It's over. I'm gone. Finished. Over. I will never work for you again. Look at you. (laughing) You think you're an important man? Is that what you think? You are a laughingstock. You are a joke. These people are laughing at you. You're nothing! You have no brains, no ability, nothing! (knocking object over on desk) I quit!
Jerry's Apartment|action|Jerry exits his bedroom with a bag of laundry; Kramer enters
Jerry's Apartment|KRAMER|Hey.
Jerry's Apartment|JERRY|Hey.
Jerry's Apartment|KRAMER|Boy, I have really had it with Newman. He wakes me up again last night at three o'clock in the morning to tell me he's going up onto the roof to kill himself.
Jerry's Apartment|JERRY|Well, what'd you say?
Jerry's Apartment|KRAMER|I said " Jump." Well, he's been threatening to do this for years. I said " Look, if you're gonna kill yourself do it already and stop bothering me." At least I'd respect the guy for accomplishing something.
Jerry's Apartment|JERRY|What's his problem?
Jerry's Apartment|KRAMER|No job. No women.
Jerry's Apartment|JERRY|He called the right guy.
Jerry's Apartment|KRAMER|Well, what am I supposed to tell him? How much there is for him to live for? Why should I lie to him?
Jerry's Apartment|JERRY|All right, I'm leaving. I going to the laundry.
Jerry's Apartment|KRAMER|Why don't you use the machines down in the basement?
Jerry's Apartment|JERRY|Fluff and Fold. The only way to live. (snapping fingers in tune with words) I drop it off. I pick it up. It's a delight.
Jerry's Apartment|KRAMER|How 'bout if I put a few things --
Jerry's Apartment|JERRY|Wait a sec. I don't wanna do --
Jerry's Apartment|KRAMER|Well, you're going over there.
Jerry's Apartment|JERRY|I don't wanna mix in everything! My guys don't know your guys. You can't just lock 'em all in the same machine together. They'll start a riot.
Jerry's Apartment|KRAMER|Have you ever met my guys?
Jerry's Apartment|JERRY|No. I can't say as I have.
Jerry's Apartment|KRAMER|Well!
Jerry's Apartment|JERRY|All right. Put 'em on top.
Jerry's Apartment|KRAMER|Ah!
Jerry's Apartment|JERRY|Oh, beautiful.
Laundromat|JERRY|This stuff on top is my friends. Could I get it done in a separate machine?
Laundromat|VIC|I'll have to charge you for another machine.
Laundromat|JERRY|Whatever it costs. In fact, I would prefer it if the machines are not even touching each other. Because something could, you know, jump across.
Laundromat|action|George shows up
Laundromat|GEORGE|Guess what.
Laundromat|JERRY|How did you know I was here?
Laundromat|GEORGE|Kramer. Guess what.
Laundromat|JERRY|I don't know.
Laundromat|GEORGE|I quit my job.
Laundromat|JERRY|Get outta here.
Laundromat|GEORGE|I couldn't take it anymore.
Laundromat|VIC|You can have this on Monday. (hands Jerry a ticket)
Laundromat|JERRY|What happened? Levitan?
Laundromat|GEORGE|I go in to use his private bathroom, everybody uses it, and then I get a memo - a memo - telling me to use the men's room in the hall. Well, (laughing) I mean we share it with Pace Electronics. It's disgusting!
Laundromat|JERRY|You and your toilets.
Laundromat|GEORGE|I snapped! It was the last straw. (sighs)
Laundromat|JERRY|So, what are you gonna do now? Are you gonna look for something else in real estate?
Laundromat|GEORGE|Nobody's hiring now. The market's terrible.
Laundromat|JERRY|So what are you gonna do?
Laundromat|action|George realizes he's made a mistake
Jerry's Apartment|GEORGE|I like sports. I could do something in sports.
Jerry's Apartment|JERRY|Uh-huh. Uh-huh. In what capacity?
Jerry's Apartment|GEORGE|You know, like the general manager of a baseball team or something.
Jerry's Apartment|JERRY|Yeah. Well, that - that could be tough to get.
Jerry's Apartment|GEORGE|Well, it doesn't even have to be the general manager. Maybe I could be like, an announcer. Like a color man. You know how I always make those interesting comments during the game.
Jerry's Apartment|JERRY|Yeah. Yeah. You make good comments.
Jerry's Apartment|GEORGE|What about that?
Jerry's Apartment|JERRY|Well, they tend to give those jobs to ex-ballplayers and people that are, you know, in broadcasting.
Jerry's Apartment|GEORGE|Well, that's really not fair.
Jerry's Apartment|JERRY|I know. Well, okay. Okay. What else do ya like?
Jerry's Apartment|GEORGE|Movies. I like to watch movies.
Jerry's Apartment|JERRY|Yeah. Yeah.
Jerry's Apartment|GEORGE|Do they pay people to watch movies?
Jerry's Apartment|JERRY|Projectionists.
Jerry's Apartment|GEORGE|That's true.
Jerry's Apartment|JERRY|But you gotta know how to work the projector.
Jerry's Apartment|GEORGE|Right.
Jerry's Apartment|JERRY|And it's probably a union thing.
Jerry's Apartment|GEORGE|(scoffs) Those unions. (sighs) Okay. Sports,...movies. What about a talk show host?
Jerry's Apartment|JERRY|Talk show host. That's good.
Jerry's Apartment|GEORGE|I think I'd be good at that. I talk to people all the time. Someone even told me once they thought I'd be a good talk show host.
Jerry's Apartment|JERRY|Really?
Jerry's Apartment|GEORGE|Yeah. A couple of people. I don't get that, though. Where do you start?
Jerry's Apartment|JERRY|Well, that's where it gets tricky.
Jerry's Apartment|GEORGE|You can't just walk into a building and say " I wanna be a talk show host."
Jerry's Apartment|JERRY|I wouldn't think so.
Jerry's Apartment|GEORGE|It's all politics.
Jerry's Apartment|JERRY|All right. Okay. Sports, movies, talk show host. What else?
Jerry's Apartment|GEORGE|This could have been a huge mistake.
Jerry's Apartment|JERRY|Well, it doesn't sound like you completely thought this through.
Jerry's Apartment|GEORGE|(sighs) Guess not. What should I do?
Jerry's Apartment|JERRY|Maybe you can just go back.
Jerry's Apartment|GEORGE|Go back?
Jerry's Apartment|JERRY|Yeah. Pretend like it never happened.
Jerry's Apartment|GEORGE|You mean just walk into the staff meeting on Monday morning like it never happened?
Jerry's Apartment|JERRY|Sure. You're an emotional person. People don't take you seriously.
Jerry's Apartment|GEORGE|Just..go back. Pretend the whole thing never happened.
Jerry's Apartment|JERRY|Never happened.
Jerry's Apartment|GEORGE|I was just blowin' off a little steam. So what?
Jerry's Apartment|JERRY|So what? You're entitled.
Jerry's Apartment|GEORGE|I'm emotional.
Jerry's Apartment|JERRY|That's right. You're emotional.
Jerry's Apartment|GEORGE|Never happened.
Jerry's Apartment|JERRY|Never happened.
Middle Monologue|JERRY|To me the most annoying thing about the couple of times that I did work in an office. Is that when you go in, in the morning you say Hi to everyone and for some reason throughout the day you have to continue to greet these people all day every time you see them. I mean you walk in "morning Bill, morning Bob, how you doing? fine" Ten minutes later you see him in the hall, "How ya doin'?" Every time you pass you gotta come up with another little greeting. You know you start racking your brains you know you do the little eyebrow "Hey" You start coming up with nicknames for them. "Jimbo."
Office complex; Staff Meeting|action|George enters
Office complex; Staff Meeting|GEORGE|How ya doin'?
Office complex; Staff Meeting|GLENDA|What are you doing here?

Office complex; Staff Meeting|DAN|Fine weekend.
Office complex; Staff Meeting|GEORGE|Yeah. Good weekend.

Office complex; Staff Meeting|action|Levitan enters; George covers his face with a folder
Office complex; Staff Meeting|LEVITAN|Ava, what happened to you Friday afternoon?

Office complex; Staff Meeting|action|laughter breaks out in boardroom
Office complex; Staff Meeting|LEVITAN|I wanna remind everyone that the tenth anniversary party for Rick Barr Properties is gonna be Wednesday afternoon at four o'clock in Lasky's Bar, on Madison 48th. I want all of you to be there. This really means a lot to me. Is that Costanza over there? What are you doing here?
Office complex; Staff Meeting|GEORGE|What?
Office complex; Staff Meeting|LEVITAN|Am I crazy, or didn't you quit?
Office complex; Staff Meeting|GEORGE|When?
Office complex; Staff Meeting|LEVITAN|Friday.
Office complex; Staff Meeting|GEORGE|Oh, what? What? That? Are you kidding? I didn't quit. What? You took that seriously?
Office complex; Staff Meeting|LEVITAN|You mean, laughingstock? All that stuff?
Office complex; Staff Meeting|GEORGE|Come on. Will you stop it.
Office complex; Staff Meeting|LEVITAN|No brains? No ability?
Office complex; Staff Meeting|GEORGE|Teasing.
Office complex; Staff Meeting|LEVITAN|Okay. I want you outta here.
Office complex; Staff Meeting|GEORGE|I don't know where you're getting this from. I....you're serious aren't you? Oh, (laughing) you see? You see, you just don't know my sense of humor. Dan, don't I joke around all the time?
Office complex; Staff Meeting|DAN|I wouldn't say all the time.
Office complex; Staff Meeting|LEVITAN|You can't win. You can't beat me. That's why I'm here and you're there. Because I'm a winner. I'll always be a winner and you'll always be a loser.
Laundromat|GEORGE|" I'll always be a winner and you'll always be a loser." This is what he said to me.
Laundromat|JERRY|Well, so that's that.
Laundromat|GEORGE|No. That's not that.
Laundromat|JERRY|That's not that?
Laundromat|GEORGE|No.
Laundromat|JERRY|Well, if that's not that, what is that?
Laundromat|GEORGE|I've got some plans. I got plans.
Laundromat|JERRY|What kind of plans?
Laundromat|GEORGE|What's the difference?
Laundromat|JERRY|You don't wanna tell me?
Laundromat|GEORGE|I'm gonna slip him a mickey.
Laundromat|JERRY|What? In his drink? Are you outta your mind? What are you Peter Lorre?
Laundromat|GEORGE|You don't understand. He's got this big party coming up. He's been looking forward to this for months. This is gonna destroy the whole thing.
Laundromat|JERRY|What if you destroy him?
Laundromat|GEORGE|No. No. No. No. No. Don't worry. It's perfectly safe. I researched it. He'll get a little woozy. He might keel over.
Laundromat|JERRY|Well, wha - what does that do? Big deal.
Laundromat|GEORGE|This is what they would do in the movies! It's a beautiful thing! It's like a movie! I'm gonna slip him a mickey!
Laundromat|JERRY|You've really gone mental.
Laundromat|GEORGE|Nah.
Laundromat|JERRY|Where are you gonna get this mickey? I can't believe I'm saying "mickey"!
Laundromat|GEORGE|I got a source.
Laundromat|JERRY|You got a mickey source?
Laundromat|GEORGE|And Elaine is gonna keep him busy.
Laundromat|JERRY|Elaine? How did you rope her into this?
Laundromat|GEORGE|I told her what a sexist he is. How he cheats on his wife.
Laundromat|JERRY|She knew that.
Laundromat|GEORGE|But she didn't know he doesn't recycle.
Laundromat|JERRY|What is the point of all this?
Laundromat|GEORGE|Revenge.
Laundromat|JERRY|Oh, the best revenge is living well.
Laundromat|GEORGE|There's no chance of that.
Jerry's apartment|action|Kramer enters somewhat depressed

Jerry's apartment|KRAMER|Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Jerry's apartment|JERRY|What did you say?
Jerry's apartment|KRAMER|I said " Wave to me when you pass my window."
Jerry's apartment|JERRY|Whew. Did he wave?
Jerry's apartment|KRAMER|No! He jumped from the second floor. Mr. Papanickolous saw him from across the street. He's lying out there faking. See, he's trying to get back at me.
Jerry's apartment|JERRY|(realizing something) Oh, my god!
Jerry's apartment|KRAMER|What's the matter?
Jerry's apartment|JERRY|(tearing through his laundry bag) Well, on Thursday when I came home I had $1500 on me. For some reason I decided to hide it in my laundry bag and then I completely forgot about it...and then I took the laundry in on Friday! Oh, come on, let's go.
Jerry's apartment|KRAMER|Where? Where?
Jerry's apartment|JERRY|To the Laundromat.
Laundromat|VIC|I never saw it.
Laundromat|KRAMER|Okay. Come on. Give the guy his money. What -- what are you doing?
Laundromat|VIC|Hey, you see that sign right there? (Points to a sign saying "Not Responsible for Valuables"
Laundromat|JERRY|Oh, I see. So, you put up a sign so you can do whatever you want? You're not a part of society.
Laundromat|VIC|Yea that's right, 'cuz this place is my country and I'm the president, and that's my constitution. I'm not responsible.
Laundromat|JERRY|So, anybody leaves anything here, you can just take it? You have a license to steal? You are like the James Bond of laundry?
Laundromat|VIC|You ever hear of a bank?
Laundromat|JERRY|Come on. Let's go.
Laundromat|KRAMER|No. You can't let him get away with this.

Office party at the Bar|ELAINE|Yeah. It is kind of cool.
Office party at the Bar|GEORGE|First time in my life I've ever gotten back at someone.
Office party at the Bar|ELAINE|I can't believe we're doing this. This is the kind of thing they do in the movies.

Laundromat|KRAMER|Well, it'll gonna mix up with the water, and then by the end of the cycle it'll be a solid block!

Office party at the Bar|LEVITAN|(confused) You're welcome.
Office party at the Bar|ELAINE|People don't say " God bless you " as much as they used to. Have you noticed that?
Office party at the Bar|LEVITAN|No.
Office party at the Bar|ELAINE|(having trouble getting him to pay attention) So, I'm going to a nudist colony next week.
Office party at the Bar|LEVITAN|(interested) Nudist colony?
Office party at the Bar|ELAINE|Oh, yeah. Yeah. I love nudist colonies. They help me..unwind. Aah!
Office party at the Bar|LEVITAN|(laughing) I'd never been to a nudist colony.
Office party at the Bar|ELAINE|Oh, really? Oh, you should go. They're great. They're great. Of course, when it's over, it's - it's hard to get used to all this clothing, you know. So, a lot of times, I'll just lock the door to my office and I'll just sit there naked.

Laundromat|JERRY|Do you think it's effeminate for a man to put clothes in a gentle cycle?
Laundromat|action|Kramer emptying bag into machine

Jerry's Apartment|JERRY|What? (Kramer hands Jerry an envelope) My God, the money! The 1500! Where'd you find it?
Jerry's Apartment|KRAMER|It was in my laundry.
Jerry's Apartment|JERRY|In your laundry the whole time? I told you not to mix in our guys. What did we figure the damage on that machine would be?
Jerry's Apartment|KRAMER|It was about 1200 bucks.
Jerry's Apartment|NEWMAN|Kramer!
Jerry's Apartment|KRAMER|Oh! That's Newman. (goes over to the window)

Jerry's Apartment|KRAMER|You wanna shoot some pool tonight?
Jerry's Apartment|NEWMAN|I can't. I'm goin' to a movie.
Jerry's Apartment|GEORGE|(talking to nobody) Nah. It's probably a union thing.
Closing Monologue|JERRY|People like the idea of revenge. Have you ever heard the expression 'The best revenge is living well' I've said this, in other words it means supposedly the best way to get back at someone is just by being happy and successful in your own life. Sounds nice, doesn't really work on that Charles Bronson. kinda level. You know what I mean, those movies where his whole family gets wiped out by some street scum. You think you could go up to him, 'Charlie forgot about the 357 what you need is a custom-made suit and a convertible. New carpeting, french doors, a divan. That'll show those punks.'
