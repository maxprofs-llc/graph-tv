Restaurant|JERRY|So you didn't even let the doctor treat you?
Restaurant|MORTY|I wouldn't give him the satisfaction.
Restaurant|HELEN|Why did you leave your wallet in your pants?
Restaurant|MORTY|What are you talking about? What was I supposed to hide it somewhere?
Restaurant|HELEN|You could've taken it with you.
Restaurant|MORTY|Oh, yeah, I'll be lying on an X-Ray table with my wallet in my mouth.
Restaurant|action|Leo enters
Restaurant|LEO|Hello...
Restaurant|JERRY|Hi Uncle Leo.
Restaurant|LEO|I just talked to Dr. Dembrow's son. He said they almost had to call the police.
Restaurant|MORTY|What are you talking about? I'm the one who should have called the police. They stole my wallet.
Restaurant|LEO|You know how hard it was for me to get that appointment for you? You can't just walk in on this guy. He did me a personal favor.
Restaurant|MORTY|All right, Leo.
Restaurant|LEO|And you walked out without paying.
Restaurant|MORTY|How was I supposed to pay? I didn't have my wallet.
Restaurant|LEO|Well, I hope you send him a check.
Restaurant|MORTY|What for?
Restaurant|LEO|What for? This man was nice enough to see you. He did me a personal favor.
Restaurant|MORTY|That's the second time you said "personal favor". Why do you keep saying that?
Restaurant|LEO|I said it once.
Restaurant|MORTY|Twice! And Dembrow doesn't even know you. His son happens to live on your floor.
Restaurant|action|Leo does a little chair dance in his seat -- Mocking Morty with his hands and mouth
Restaurant|HELEN|Leo, where did you get that watch?
Restaurant|LEO|You know where I got this? (flashback) I found it in the garbage can. It kept terrible time. I brought it over to Jimmy Sherman right here on 85th and Columbus. Gave it to me back the next day. Works great. What kind of idiot throws a way a perfectly good watch?
Restaurant|HELEN|Morty, doesn't that watch look like the one that we gave Jerry.
Restaurant|action|Morty reaches across the table at the watch on Leo's wrist
Restaurant|JERRY|Hey, where's the waiter. Dad, what say we have some red meat tonight. Let's live a little. .
Restaurant|HELEN|Let me see that.
