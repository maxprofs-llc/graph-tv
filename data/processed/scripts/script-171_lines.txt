Monk's|GEORGE|When are they gonna learn that any news about China is an instant page-turner? (seeing Jerry with a small black device) What's that?
Monk's|JERRY|It's a Wizard electronic organizer for my dad. I'm goin' to Florida for his birthday.
Monk's|GEORGE|How much was it?
Monk's|JERRY|Two hundred. But I'll tell him it's fifty. He doesn't care about the gift. He gets excited about the deal.
Monk's|GEORGE|Where are you gettin' a Wizard for fifty dollars?
Monk's|JERRY|Ah, I'll tell him I got it on the street, and maybe it's hot. That's his favorite.
Monk's|GEORGE|I got a message from the Rosses at work today.
Monk's|JERRY|Susan's parents? When's the last time you talked to them?
Monk's|GEORGE|At the funeral, give or take. You know, deep down, I always kinda felt that they blamed me for Susan's death.
Monk's|JERRY|Why, because you picked out the poision envelopes? That's silly.
Monk's|ELAINE|(entering Monk's with her boyfriend) Oh, um... Darryl. These are... people I know. Jerry, George.
Monk's|DARRYL|Nice meeting you. Ah, I gotta run, Elaine. I'll see you later.
Monk's|ELAINE|OK.
Monk's|JERRY|Still no Puddy?
Monk's|ELAINE|Uh, I think his answering machine's broken, so I just gave up. Well, what do you think?
Monk's|JERRY|What? About you datin' a black guy? What's the big deal?
Monk's|ELAINE|What black guy?
Monk's|JERRY|Darryl. He's black, isn't he?
Monk's|ELAINE|He is?
Monk's|GEORGE|No, he isn't.
Monk's|JERRY|Isn't he, Elaine?
Monk's|ELAINE|You think?
Monk's|GEORGE|I thought he looked Irish.
Monk's|JERRY|What's his last name?
Monk's|ELAINE|Nelson.
Monk's|GEORGE|That's not Irish.
Monk's|JERRY|I think he's black.
Monk's|GEORGE|Should we be talkin' about this?
Monk's|ELAINE|I think it's OK.
Monk's|GEORGE|No, it isn't.
Monk's|JERRY|Why not?
Monk's|GEORGE|Well, it would be OK if Darryl was here.
Monk's|JERRY|If he's black.
Monk's|ELAINE|Is he black?
Monk's|JERRY|Does it matter?
Monk's|ELAINE|No, course not. I mean, I'd just like to know.
Monk's|JERRY|Oh, so you need to know?
Monk's|ELAINE|No, I don't need to know. I just think it would be nice if I knew.
Monk's|WAITRESS|Should I take that?
Monk's|JERRY|(getting out his wallet) Uh, one second.
Monk's|ELAINE|(looking in her purse) Oh, here.
Monk's|GEORGE|(pulling out some money) Uh, yeah. Hang on. Just... yeah.
Monk's|action|when they see the waitress, who is black, all three hurriedly get out lots of money for her tip
Jerry's Apartment|GEORGE|(on the phone) Uh, Mrs. Ross? It's-it's George.
Jerry's Apartment|GEORGE|George Costanza. Susan's, uh, friend? Long time no speak.
Jerry's Apartment|GEORGE|Oh, I just, uh, leased a house out in the Hamptons, and I have got to get out there this weekend and sign the papers.
Jerry's Apartment|GEORGE|Oh, sure. I mean, after all, you were almost my, uh... OK, I gotta go.
Jerry's Apartment|JERRY|House in the Hamptons?
Jerry's Apartment|GEORGE|Well, you know, I've been lyin' about my income for a few years. I figured I could afford a fake house in the Hamptons.
Jerry's Apartment|KRAMER|(enters) Well.
Jerry's Apartment|JERRY|Hey.
Jerry's Apartment|KRAMER|Well, grab a cigar, boys. Yeah. It's time to celebrate.
Jerry's Apartment|JERRY|Wow. What are we celebrating?
Jerry's Apartment|KRAMER|Uh, you remember my coffee table book?
Jerry's Apartment|JERRY|With the little legs?
Jerry's Apartment|KRAMER|That's the one. A big Hollywood so-and-so optioned it for a movie.
Jerry's Apartment|GEORGE|How are they gonna make that book into a movie?
Jerry's Apartment|KRAMER|You remember that photo book on toy ray guns?
Jerry's Apartment|GEORGE|Yeah?
Jerry's Apartment|KRAMER|Independence Day?
Jerry's Apartment|GEORGE|Oh.
Jerry's Apartment|JERRY|How much are they payin' you?
Jerry's Apartment|KRAMER|Let's just say that I don't have to worry about working for a while. A long while.
Jerry's Apartment|JERRY|That's funny because I haven't seen you working for a while. A long while.
Jerry's Apartment|KRAMER|Yeah, and you're not going to, because I'm hanging it up. Boys, I'm retiring.
Jerry's Apartment|JERRY|From what?
Jerry's Apartment|KRAMER|From the grind. I mean, who needs it? I mean, I've accomplished everything I've set out to do.
Jerry's Apartment|JERRY|(seeing that Kramer has a new watch) What's that?
Jerry's Apartment|KRAMER|Oh, I bought myself a little retirement gift. Gold watch.
Jerry's Apartment|KRAMER|Well, it's not really gold.
Darryl's Apartment|action|approaching Darryl's apartment, Elaine hears loud rap music being played, and smiles knowingly
Darryl's Apartment|ELAINE|(as Darryl opens his door) Hey.
Darryl's Apartment|DARRYL|Hey.
Darryl's Apartment|ELAINE|Great music.
Darryl's Apartment|DARRYL|Oh, it's my neighbor. They blast that stuff twenty four hours a day. I hate it.
Darryl's Apartment|DARRYL|Yo, you! Turn it down!
Darryl's Apartment|ELAINE|Oh, wow, these are nice. Do they have any cultural significance?
Darryl's Apartment|DARRYL|They're... African.
Darryl's Apartment|ELAINE|Right. African.
Darryl's Apartment|DARRYL|Well, not Africa, actually. South Africa.
Darryl's Apartment|ELAINE|South Africa.
Darryl's Apartment|DARRYL|My family used to live there, but, uh, we got out years ago, for obvious reasons. You know how it is.
Darryl's Apartment|ELAINE|Maybe.
Street|GEORGE|(to a street vender selling hot dogs) You must hate hot dogs, huh? Or else, you, uh, you really like 'em and that's why you, you do this.
Street|action|the Rosses come out of a nearby building onto the street, observe George not being in the Hamptons, and move on
Street|GEORGE|I'll tell ya, if I had one of these things, I'd be eatin' hot dogs all the time.
Street|VENDER|Are you gonna buy a hot dog or not?
Street|GEORGE|Mmm... no.
Florida- Seinfeld Condo|MORTY|(Jerry comes out of his room, having just woken up) Rise and shine, sleepy head! Ha ha!
Florida- Seinfeld Condo|JERRY|It's 5:30 in the morning!
Florida- Seinfeld Condo|HELEN|We let you sleep in.
Florida- Seinfeld Condo|JERRY|(handing his dad a gift) Well, as long as I'm up. Dad, I got you a birthday present. Here. Happy Birthday.
Florida- Seinfeld Condo|MORTY|Aw, Jerry. I should be buyin' you presents.
Florida- Seinfeld Condo|JERRY|What does that mean?
Florida- Seinfeld Condo|HELEN|Leave your father alone. It's his birthday.
Florida- Seinfeld Condo|MORTY|Oooh! Heh heh! It's a radar detector.
Florida- Seinfeld Condo|JERRY|Radar detector? I've never seen you go over twenty miles an hour. You're like the Grand Marshall of the Rose Bowl Parade. It's a Wizard organizer.
Florida- Seinfeld Condo|MORTY|This looks like too much money.
Florida- Seinfeld Condo|JERRY|Nah, I got it from a guy on the street. It was, like, fifty bucks.
Florida- Seinfeld Condo|MORTY|You think it's hot?
Florida- Seinfeld Condo|JERRY|Could be.
Florida- Seinfeld Condo|MORTY|Attaboy! Helen, Jerry got me a hot Wizard computer!
Florida- Seinfeld Condo|HELEN|I'm right here.
Florida- Seinfeld Condo|JERRY|And you can do everything with it. You can get e-mail, fax, there's a calculator.
Florida- Seinfeld Condo|MORTY|So, I can use it in the restaurant to figure out the tip?
Florida- Seinfeld Condo|JERRY|Yeah, I guess. But the really cool thing is the daily planner.
Florida- Seinfeld Condo|MORTY|Helen, we got into restaurants and figure out the tips.
Florida- Seinfeld Condo|HELEN|Jerry, you're getting your father too excited.
Florida- Seinfeld Condo|KRAMER|(entering the condo, and going to the fridge as if he's a neighbor) Hey, buddy. When'd you get here?
Florida- Seinfeld Condo|JERRY|Kramer, what are you doing here?
Florida- Seinfeld Condo|KRAMER|I told you I was retiring. I moved in next door.
Florida- Seinfeld Condo|HELEN|Mr. Kornstein died, and it's a beautiful apartment.
Florida- Seinfeld Condo|KRAMER|Yeah, your, uh, folks said it was for rent, so I jumped on it.
Florida- Seinfeld Condo|JERRY|Kramer, you can't live down here. This is where people come to die.
Florida- Seinfeld Condo|JERRY|(getting looks from his parents) Not you. Older people.
Florida- Seinfeld Condo|HELEN|Don't eat cookies for breakfast! I'll fix you something. How 'bout a feta cheese omelette?
Florida- Seinfeld Condo|KRAMER|Mmmm, that sounds great, Mom.
Florida- Seinfeld Condo|JERRY|If you feed him, he'll never leave.
Florida- Seinfeld Condo|HELEN|We don't have any feta. How about cottage cheese and Egg Beaters?
Florida- Seinfeld Condo|KRAMER|(immaturely) I guess.
Florida- Seinfeld Condo|JERRY|I can't believe this.
Florida- Seinfeld Condo|KRAMER|I know, I know. Don't I look more relaxed?
Monk's|ELAINE|So, George, do you have any thoughts on this Darryl situation?
Monk's|GEORGE|Actually, I did have a thought.
Monk's|ELAINE|Oh.
Monk's|GEORGE|Why don't you just ask him?
Monk's|ELAINE|(rudely and giving him a 'duh' look) Because, if I ask him, then it's like I really want to know.
Monk's|GEORGE|Maybe he's, um... mixed.
Monk's|ELAINE|Is that the right word?
Monk's|GEORGE|I really don't think we're supposed to be talkin' about this.
Monk's|ELAINE|Yeah.
Monk's|GEORGE|(standing up) I'm just gonna go to the bathroom.
Monk's|ELAINE|(starting to leave) You know what, I'm leavin'.
Monk's|GEORGE|Yeah.
Monk's|ELAINE|I'll just talk to Jerry when he gets back. (seeing the Rosses entering Monk's) Oh. Mrs. Ross, Mr. Ross.
Monk's|ELAINE|(laughing uproariously) The Hamptons? George Costanza? I, uh... I don't think so. Have a good one.
Monk's|GEORGE|Rosses.
Monk's|GEORGE|Well, sorry I missed that, uh, charity thing. But this was one of those truly glorious Hampton weekends that you always hear about.
Monk's|GEORGE|Yeah, I may move out there. (getting 'yeah, right' glances from the Rosses) I mean it, I'll do it! OK, I'll see ya later. Keep it real!
Florida- Restaurant|MORTY|(eating lunch with Helen and Jerry) Another fine meal, and now for my Wizard tip calculator.
Florida- Restaurant|JERRY|Dad, it's got lots of other functions.
Florida- Restaurant|MORTY|Don't worry. I'll get to the other functions. (trying to open it) I can't get it open.
Florida- Restaurant|action|Jerry easily opens it
Florida- Restaurant|HELEN|Yay! Jerry got it open.
Florida- Restaurant|MORTY|The service was slow. And God forbid they should refill the water. How does 12.4% sound?
Florida- Restaurant|JERRY|(looking at the Wizard) Well, your tip is four dollars and thirty-six point six six six six cents.
Florida- Restaurant|MORTY|We'll round down.
Florida- Restaurant|HELEN|Jerry, it was so nice of you to come down here on your father's birthday. You've helped take his mind off the condo elections.
Florida- Restaurant|JERRY|Oh, right. You can't run for condo president because you were impeached at the other condo.
Florida- Restaurant|MORTY|I was never impeached! I resigned!
Florida- Restaurant|HELEN|Even so, the press would bury him!
Florida- Restaurant|JERRY|What press?
Florida- Restaurant|HELEN|The condo newsletter, the Boca Breeze.
Florida- Restaurant|MORTY|Pinko Commie rag.
Florida- clubhouse|JERRY|She's fifty.
Florida- clubhouse|KRAMER|All right, I'll see you guys.
Florida- clubhouse|KRAMER|Yeah.
Florida- clubhouse|action|Kramer, scanning the scene, is surprised to see Morty, right next to him, staring at his face
Florida- clubhouse|KRAMER|(taping Morty's glasses) Morty, what're you lookin' at?
Florida- clubhouse|MORTY|I'll tell you what I'm looking at: the next condo president of Del Boca Vista, Phase Three.
Florida- clubhouse|KRAMER|Hmm.
Darryl's Apartment|DARRYL|Elaine, thank you for the Wizard!
Darryl's Apartment|action|Elaine laughts somewhat awkwardly
Darryl's Apartment|DARRYL|Wow, it's got so many functions.
Darryl's Apartment|ELAINE|Yeah, yeah. Forget about all that. First thing is first. Warranty information. Name, we know that. Uh, hobbies. Skiing, racquetball...
Darryl's Apartment|DARRYL|Well, I don't do that stuff.
Darryl's Apartment|ELAINE|It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter, it doesn't matter. Um. Oh, here's one: race.
Darryl's Apartment|DARRYL|Isn't that optional?
Darryl's Apartment|ELAINE|It certainly should be. It's nobody's damn business! But they really would like to know.
Darryl's Apartment|DARRYL|All right, I'm... Asian.
Darryl's Apartment|ELAINE|What?
Darryl's Apartment|DARRYL|Just to mess with 'em.
Darryl's Apartment|ELAINE|laughing awkwardly: Oh. Right. Good one.
Darryl's Apartment|DARRYL|Average income, uh... over a hundred thousand.
Darryl's Apartment|ELAINE|Really?
Darryl's Apartment|DARRYL|Does that matter?
Darryl's Apartment|ELAINE|No, but... it is very nice to know.
Florida- Seinfeld Condo|JERRY|(in his parent's condo, on the phone with Elaine) So did you figure out Darryl's... you know.
Florida- Seinfeld Condo|ELAINE|(in Jerry's apartment) Ah, I've given up. So, now we're going to a bunch of Spanish restaurants. I figure that'll cover us either way.
Florida- Seinfeld Condo|JERRY|(as Kramer walks by) You're a master of race relations.
Florida- Seinfeld Condo|ELAINE|Hey, so Kramer's running for president of the condo?
Florida- Seinfeld Condo|JERRY|Yeah, it's all my father's doing.
Florida- Seinfeld Condo|action|Kramer, apparently looking for something to do, mumbles to Jerry to hand him a magazine from the table
Florida- Seinfeld Condo|JERRY|He wants to install Kramer in a puppet regime and then wield power from behind the scenes. Preferably from the sauna in the clubhouse.
Florida- Seinfeld Condo|ELAINE|Oh, heh heh heh. Who are they running against?
Florida- Seinfeld Condo|JERRY|Common sense and a guy in a wheelchair.
Florida- Seinfeld Condo|GEORGE|(entering Jerry's apartment) Jerry?
Florida- Seinfeld Condo|ELAINE|(to George) He's still down with his folks.
Florida- Seinfeld Condo|GEORGE|(to Elaine) What are you doin' here?
Florida- Seinfeld Condo|JERRY|(overhearing the other two: Elaine, Elaine--
Florida- Seinfeld Condo|ELAINE|(to George) I'm gettin' his mail.
Florida- Seinfeld Condo|JERRY|(overhearing the other two) Oh, no.
Florida- Seinfeld Condo|GEORGE|(to Elaine) He asked you to get the mail?
Florida- Seinfeld Condo|ELAINE|(to George) Mm-hmm.
Florida- Seinfeld Condo|GEORGE|(taking the phone from Elaine) Jerry, why is Elaine getting your mail?
Florida- Seinfeld Condo|JERRY|George, listen to me. I have a very important job for you. I want you to come by twice a day and flush the toilet so the gaskets don't dry out and leak.
Florida- Seinfeld Condo|ELAINE|(trying to understand what they're talking about) What?
Florida- Seinfeld Condo|GEORGE|What about the mail?
Florida- Seinfeld Condo|JERRY|This is far more important. You must exercise the gaskets, George.
Florida- Seinfeld Condo|GEORGE|(hanging up) All right, Jerry. I'll do it. See ya.
Jerry's apartment|GEORGE|So, I ran into the Rosses again.
Jerry's apartment|ELAINE|Oh, right, at the coffee shop. Where did they get the idea that you have a place in the Hamptons?
Jerry's apartment|GEORGE|From me.
Jerry's apartment|ELAINE|What did you say?
Jerry's apartment|GEORGE|I told them I have a place in the Hamptons. What did you say?
Jerry's apartment|ELAINE|I told them you didn't. And I laughed and I laughed.
Jerry's apartment|GEORGE|So, they knew? Those liars!
Jerry's apartment|ELAINE|But you lied first.
Jerry's apartment|GEORGE|Yeah, but they let me go on and on all about the Hamptons, they never said a thing! You don't let somebody lie when they know you're lying. You call them a liar!
Jerry's apartment|ELAINE|Like you're a liar!
Jerry's apartment|GEORGE|Yes. Thank you! Is that so hard?
Jerry's apartment|ELAINE|So, this is over, not over? I'm bettin', not over.
Jerry's apartment|GEORGE|Hmm-hmm, not by a long shot. I'm calling up the Rosses and inviting them up to my non-existent place in the Hamptons. Then we'll see who blinks first.
Jerry's apartment|ELAINE|Haven't you done enough to these people?
Jerry's apartment|GEORGE|This is not about them. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to exercise Jerry's gaskets.
Jerry's apartment|action|Elaine gets a sarcastic, 'oh, boy' expression
Florida- Kramer Campaigning|KRAMER|(to a room) Vote for Kramer. (to a man walking by) Cosmo Kramer. I'm running for condo president. I'd like your vote. Thanks. (to an old woman) Remember, ma'am, a vote for me, is a vote for Kramer.
Florida- Kramer Campaigning|KRAMER|Gladly.
Monk's|WAITRESS|(to Darryl) Coffee?
Monk's|DARRYL|Sure.
Monk's|WAITRESS|(to Darryl) Are you black? Or should I bring some cream.
Monk's|DARRYL|I'm black. (re-thinking) Oh, you know what? Bring a little cream. (seeing a couple gesturing towards him and Elaine) Did you hear that?
Monk's|ELAINE|What?
Monk's|DARRYL|God, there are still people who have trouble with an interracial couple.
Monk's|ELAINE|Interracial? Us?
Monk's|DARRYL|Isn't that unbelievable!?
Monk's|ELAINE|Yes, it's awful! They're upset because we're an interracial couple. That is racism!
Monk's|DARRYL|I don't feel like eating.
Monk's|ELAINE|Me neither. Well, maybe this turkey club.
Outside the Ross'|GEORGE|So... here I am. Ready to take you to the Hamptons.
Outside the Ross'|GEORGE|Do you have your bathing suits?
Outside the Ross'|GEORGE|Speak now, or we are headed to the Hamptons. It's a two-hour drive. Once you get in that car, we are going all the way... to the Hamptons. All right, you wanna get nuts? Come on. Let's get nuts!
Florida-Seinfeld Condo|JERRY|(in his parent's condo, to his father, who's in another room) Hey, Dad. You know you can program this thing to beep every time you need to take a vitamin. (as Kramer comes walking out in a retirement-like athletic sweatsuit) Dad, you look so different.
Florida-Seinfeld Condo|KRAMER|Oh, no. We're campaigning, Jerry. To rule the people, one... must walk among them.
Florida-Seinfeld Condo|MORTY|(coming into the hall) This is the home stretch. Tomorrow's the election!
Florida-Seinfeld Condo|KRAMER|Right. Yeah. The polls close after dinner, three o'clock. But then when we win, the celebration goes all night until the break of eight p.m.
Florida-Seinfeld Condo|JERRY|You know, you can put that whole schedule right in your daily planner.
Florida-Seinfeld Condo|MORTY|Daily what?
Florida-Seinfeld Condo|HELEN|(coming into the condo) Have you read today's Boca Breeze?
Florida-Seinfeld Condo|KRAMER|(looking at the newsletter) Hey, look at that. Picture of me, huh? (reading out loud) Candidate Cosmo Kramer caught barefoot in clubhouse.
Florida-Seinfeld Condo|MORTY|Barefoot in the clubhouse? Don't you realize this is against the rules.
Florida-Seinfeld Condo|KRAMER|Well, I couldn't find my shoes.
Florida-Seinfeld Condo|JERRY|Kramer, these people work and wait their whole lives to move down here, sit in the heat, pretend it's not hot, and enforce these rules.
Florida-Seinfeld Condo|HELEN|Who wants hot chocolate?
Florida-Seinfeld Condo|KRAMER|Oh, yeah! Me.
Florida-Seinfeld Condo|MORTY|This is a huge scandal! We need damage control.
Florida-Seinfeld Condo|KRAMER|All right, look. People seem to like those tip calculators, huh?
Florida-Seinfeld Condo|JERRY|Wizards!
Florida-Seinfeld Condo|KRAMER|Yeah, well, how 'bout if we give one out to every member on the condo board.
Florida-Seinfeld Condo|JERRY|Kramer...
Florida-Seinfeld Condo|MORTY|There are twenty people on the board. Thank God you can get that deal.
Florida-Seinfeld Condo|KRAMER|Payoffs. Now we're playin' politics. All right, what do we next, Morty, huh? Wiretaps, slush funds?
Florida-Seinfeld Condo|MORTY|(rushing to his bedroom) First, I need a nap.
Florida-Seinfeld Condo|HELEN|(running after him) Oh, I'll get your electric blanket!
Florida-Seinfeld Condo|JERRY|Kramer, I can't get that many Wizards.
Florida-Seinfeld Condo|KRAMER|Well, what about your deal, huh?
Florida-Seinfeld Condo|JERRY|I didn't have a deal! They're two hundred dollars a pop. What do I do?
Florida-Seinfeld Condo|KRAMER|Well, don't worry about it. I know a guy.
Florida-Seinfeld Condo|JERRY|Down here?
Florida-Seinfeld Condo|KRAMER|Yeah, Bob Saccamano's father.
George's Car|GEORGE|You want to hear more? The master bedroom opens into the solarium.
George's Car|GEORGE|Yes, two solariums. Quite a find. And I have horses, too?
George's Car|GEORGE|Snoopy and Prickly Pete. Should I keep driving?
George's Car|GEORGE|(chuckling to himself) Housewarming gift. (swerving the car to go to the antique stand) All right, we're taking it up a notch!
Monk's|WAITRESS|(handing Elaine a menu) Here you go.
Monk's|ELAINE|(to the black waitress) Long day?
Monk's|WAITRESS|Yeah, I just worked a triple shift.
Monk's|ELAINE|I hear ya, Sister.
Monk's|WAITRESS|Sister?
Monk's|ELAINE|(as Darryl comes into Monk's) Yeah. It's OK. My boyfriend's black. Here he is. See?
Monk's|DARRYL|Hi, Elaine.
Monk's|ELAINE|Hey.
Monk's|WAITRESS|He's black?
Monk's|ELAINE|Yeah.
Monk's|DARRYL|I'm black?
Monk's|ELAINE|Aren't you?
Monk's|WAITRESS|(leaving) I'll give you a couple minutes to decide.
Monk's|DARRYL|What are you talking about?
Monk's|ELAINE|You're black. You said we were an interracial couple.
Monk's|DARRYL|We are. Because you're Hispanic.
Monk's|ELAINE|I am?
Monk's|DARRYL|Aren't you?
Monk's|ELAINE|No. Why would you think that?
Monk's|DARRYL|Your name's Benes, your hair, and you kept taking me to those Spanish restaurants.
Monk's|ELAINE|That's because I thought you were black.
Monk's|DARRYL|Why would you take me to a Spanish restaurant because I'm black?
Monk's|ELAINE|I don't think we should be talking about this.
Monk's|DARRYL|So, what are you?
Monk's|ELAINE|I'm white.
Monk's|DARRYL|So, we're just a couple of white people?
Monk's|ELAINE|I guess.
Monk's|DARRYL|Oh.
Monk's|ELAINE|Yeah. So do you want to go to the Gap?
Monk's|DARRYL|(leaving with Elaine) Sure.
Florida-Seinfeld Condo|KRAMER|(having lunch with Jerry and his parents) Oh, well... I handed out all the Wizards. Polls close in one hour. Whoo hoo hoo! I think we've got this baby all sewn up, huh? Oh, uh, there was an extra one. Norman Burgerman, he won't be leavin' any tips where he is.
Florida-Seinfeld Condo|JERRY|Aw.
Florida-Seinfeld Condo|MORTY|Congratulations, Mr. President.
Florida-Seinfeld Condo|KRAMER|Congratulations, Mr. Puppet Master.
Florida-Seinfeld Condo|MORTY|What are you talking about?
Florida-Seinfeld Condo|MORTY|This isn't a Wizard, it's a Willard.
Florida-Seinfeld Condo|JERRY|A Willard? Saccamano, Sr. screwed me!
Florida-Seinfeld Condo|MORTY|Jerry, why didn't you get them Wizards?
Florida-Seinfeld Condo|JERRY|Because a real Wizard's two hundred dollars.
Florida-Seinfeld Condo|MORTY|You didn't have a deal?
Florida-Seinfeld Condo|JERRY|No deal. Not hot.
Florida-Seinfeld Condo|KRAMER|What?
Florida-Seinfeld Condo|KRAMER|(getting up to leave) Well, the people have spoken. Well, that's it for me. I'm, I'm headin' back to New York.
Florida-Seinfeld Condo|JERRY|Dad, I'm sorry.
Florida-Seinfeld Condo|MORTY|You should be! How could you spend two hundred dollars on a tip calculator?!
Florida-Seinfeld Condo|JERRY|It does other things!
Outside George's Car on a beach|GEORGE|Almost there.
Outside George's Car on a beach|GEORGE|We, uh, we go on foot from here.
Outside George's Car on a beach|GEORGE|There's no house! It's a lie! There's no solarium. There's no Prickly Pete. There's no other solarium.
Outside George's Car on a beach|GEORGE|Then, why? Why did you make me drive all the way out here? Why didn't you say something? Why? Why? Why?
Outside George's Car on a beach|GEORGE|Oh.
