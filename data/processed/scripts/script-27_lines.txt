Jerry and George are in a drug store.|JERRY| I'd go, but Long Island, it's so far out, it smacks of desperation.  The whole party, everyone's gonna be saying to me, "You came all the way out from Manhattan for this?"

Jerry and George are in a drug store.|JERRY| Are you sure?  Oh boy, here we go.
Jerry and George are in a drug store.|GEORGE|(to the cashier)  Excuse me, I gave you a twenty dollar bill and you only actually gave me change for a ten.

Jerry and George are in a drug store.|CASHIER| Will you please step aside?  Next?
Jerry and George are in a drug store.|GEORGE| Alright, let's just examine the situation for a second.  Who, in this situation, would be more likely to make a mistake?  Me, who had access to my wallet, knew exactly what was in there?  Or you--
Jerry and George are in a drug store.|CASHIER| You.
Jerry and George are in a drug store.|GEORGE| No, no, no, see you're not really listening.
Jerry and George are in a drug store.|GEORGE| No problem.  There's no problem.  She just owes me ten dollars, that's all.
Jerry and George are in a drug store.|CASHIER| He's claiming short.
Jerry and George are in a drug store.|GEORGE| Oh, so you don't believe me either?
Jerry and George are in a drug store.|GEORGE| You haven't won.  You may think you've won, but you haven't won.  Do you know why?  It's not over.  This is not over.  I'm not forgetting what's happening here.  You have my ten dollars.  I will get it back.  Alright, don't worry.  It's not over.  I'm going now.  Good bye.  I will be back.
George, Elaine and Jerry enter The Party and stand by the door|ELAINE| Well don't stand here, let's walk in, blend in, blend in.

George, Elaine and Jerry enter The Party and stand by the door|JERRY| What could possess anyone to throw a party?  I mean, to have a bunch of strangers treat your house like a hotel room.
George, Elaine and Jerry enter The Party and stand by the door|AVA| So, guess who just sold 129 West 81st.
George, Elaine and Jerry enter The Party and stand by the door|GEORGE| Oh no you didn't.  Get out, when?
George, Elaine and Jerry enter The Party and stand by the door|AVA| Yesterday

George, Elaine and Jerry enter The Party and stand by the door|ELAINE| How did I ever let you talk me into this, I must have been out of my mind.
George, Elaine and Jerry enter The Party and stand by the door|JERRY| Now listen, let's keep an eye on each other tonight.  In case one of us gets in a bad conversation, we should have a signal that you're in trouble so the other one can get us out of it.
George, Elaine and Jerry enter The Party and stand by the door|ELAINE| How old are you?
George, Elaine and Jerry enter The Party and stand by the door|JERRY| Thirty-six.  What's the signal?  Howbout this?  Chicken wing?  No, no, no, I got a better one.  Head patting.
George, Elaine and Jerry enter The Party and stand by the door|ELAINE| Whatever you want.
George, Elaine and Jerry enter The Party and stand by the door|action|Fast forward a bit, Jerry is sitting on the couch with a stranger.
George, Elaine and Jerry enter The Party and stand by the door|GUY| You came all the way out from Manhattan for this?
George, Elaine and Jerry enter The Party and stand by the door|JERRY| Yeah, yeah I did.
George, Elaine and Jerry enter The Party and stand by the door|GUY| So what do you do?
George, Elaine and Jerry enter The Party and stand by the door|JERRY|(Patting his head:  I'm a comedian.
George, Elaine and Jerry enter The Party and stand by the door|GUY| Are you?  Lemme ask you something.  Where do you get your material?
George, Elaine and Jerry enter The Party and stand by the door|JERRY|(still Patting)  I hear a voice.
George, Elaine and Jerry enter The Party and stand by the door|GUY| What kind of voice?
George, Elaine and Jerry enter The Party and stand by the door|JERRY| A man's voice, but he speaks in German so I have to get a translator.
George, Elaine and Jerry enter The Party and stand by the door|GUY| How come you keep tapping your head.
George, Elaine and Jerry enter The Party and stand by the door|JERRY| It's a nervous tic.  I'm on L-Dopa.
George, Elaine and Jerry enter The Party and stand by the door|action|Cut to Elaine, engaged in a conversation with another guy and patting her head.
George, Elaine and Jerry enter The Party and stand by the door|GUY| On the other hand, you take a guy like George Washington Carver.  The man devoted his whole life to the peanut.  Imagine having so much passion for something.
George, Elaine and Jerry enter The Party and stand by the door|action|Cut back to Jerry and his 'guy'.
George, Elaine and Jerry enter The Party and stand by the door|GUY| Ya know, people tell me I'm a funny guy.
George, Elaine and Jerry enter The Party and stand by the door|action|Cut back to Elaine and her 'guy'.  She's still tapping madly.
George, Elaine and Jerry enter The Party and stand by the door|GUY| I've often wondered if he ever worked with the pecan.
George, Elaine and Jerry enter The Party and stand by the door|ELAINE| Yeah, me too.
George, Elaine and Jerry enter The Party and stand by the door|GUY| Now is that considered a nut, because I know the cashew is a legume.
George, Elaine and Jerry enter The Party and stand by the door|action|Cut to George, now talking with Jerry.
George, Elaine and Jerry enter The Party and stand by the door|GEORGE| How's it going?
George, Elaine and Jerry enter The Party and stand by the door|JERRY| Great, how about you?
George, Elaine and Jerry enter The Party and stand by the door|GEORGE| I can't believe what's happening here.  She hasn't taken her hands off me all night.  She was always friendly around the office, but that was it.
George, Elaine and Jerry enter The Party and stand by the door|JERRY| How do you account for this?
George, Elaine and Jerry enter The Party and stand by the door|GEORGE| I don't know, maybe a safe fell on her head.
George, Elaine and Jerry enter The Party and stand by the door|JERRY| Well, she obviously liked you all along.
George, Elaine and Jerry enter The Party and stand by the door|GEORGE| No, I would have picked up on it.  I can always tell when a woman likes me, they always somehow let you know.  With me, they could torture me, I wouldn't tell them.  If anything I'd try to make them think I don't like them, then they think, "Oh, look at this guy, he's not even looking at me, he must have something going for him."
George, Elaine and Jerry enter The Party and stand by the door|JERRY| Anyway, I'm ready to go.
George, Elaine and Jerry enter The Party and stand by the door|GEORGE| Now?

George, Elaine and Jerry enter The Party and stand by the door|action|Cut to Elaine and the 'peanut guy'.  By now, she's weary from tapping.
George, Elaine and Jerry enter The Party and stand by the door|GUY| Peanut brittle, peanut butter, peanut oil...
George, Elaine and Jerry enter The Party and stand by the door|JERRY|(interrupting)  Can I talk to you for a second?
George, Elaine and Jerry enter The Party and stand by the door|ELAINE| Oh, excuse me.  (gets up to talk with Jerry)  What have you been doing, I've been smacking myself senseless.  People think I'm a mental patient.
George, Elaine and Jerry enter The Party and stand by the door|JERRY| Hey, I was dying over there.
George, Elaine and Jerry enter The Party and stand by the door|ELAINE| This guy's going off on the peanut.  Now pay attention.
George, Elaine and Jerry enter The Party and stand by the door|action|Fast forward a bit, a woman (Ellen) is talking to Jerry.
George, Elaine and Jerry enter The Party and stand by the door|ELLEN| Yeah, I think I've seen you in a club.  You talk about a lot of everyday things, right?

George, Elaine and Jerry enter The Party and stand by the door|JERRY| You ready?
George, Elaine and Jerry enter The Party and stand by the door|GEORGE| Listen, I have a tremendous favor to ask.
George, Elaine and Jerry enter The Party and stand by the door|JERRY| I do favors.
George, Elaine and Jerry enter The Party and stand by the door|GEORGE| I think something's happening here.
George, Elaine and Jerry enter The Party and stand by the door|JERRY| What?
George, Elaine and Jerry enter The Party and stand by the door|GEORGE| I think she wants me to take her home.
George, Elaine and Jerry enter The Party and stand by the door|JERRY| Wow.
George, Elaine and Jerry enter The Party and stand by the door|GEORGE| What should I do?
George, Elaine and Jerry enter The Party and stand by the door|JERRY| Go!  What could you do?
George, Elaine and Jerry enter The Party and stand by the door|GEORGE| What about you and Elaine?
George, Elaine and Jerry enter The Party and stand by the door|JERRY| We'll get a ride.

George, Elaine and Jerry enter The Party and stand by the door|JERRY| What did you say?
George, Elaine and Jerry enter The Party and stand by the door|GEORGE| I, I, I can't.
George, Elaine and Jerry enter The Party and stand by the door|JERRY| What did you say?
George, Elaine and Jerry enter The Party and stand by the door|GEORGE| Please, it's--
George, Elaine and Jerry enter The Party and stand by the door|JERRY| What?
George, Elaine and Jerry enter The Party and stand by the door|GEORGE| I... I... I long for you.
George, Elaine and Jerry enter The Party and stand by the door|JERRY| I long for you?
George, Elaine and Jerry enter The Party and stand by the door|GEORGE| I was so shocked I was lucky I said anything.
George, Elaine and Jerry enter The Party and stand by the door|JERRY| It's okay, that's not bad.
George, Elaine and Jerry enter The Party and stand by the door|GEORGE| I don't like when a woman says, 'Make love to me', it's intimidating. The last time a woman said that to me, I wound up apologizing to her.
George, Elaine and Jerry enter The Party and stand by the door|JERRY| Really?
George, Elaine and Jerry enter The Party and stand by the door|GEORGE| That's a lot of pressure.  Make love to me.  What am I, in the circus? What if I can't deliver?
George, Elaine and Jerry enter The Party and stand by the door|JERRY| Oh, come on.
George, Elaine and Jerry enter The Party and stand by the door|GEORGE| I can't perform under pressure.  That's why I never play anything for money, I choke.  I could choke tonight.  And she works in my office, can you imagine?  She goes around telling everyone what happened?  Maybe I should cancel, I have a very bad feeling about this.
George, Elaine and Jerry enter The Party and stand by the door|JERRY| George, you're thinking too much.

George, Elaine and Jerry enter The Party and stand by the door|JERRY| Uh, no, he's taking the car.
George, Elaine and Jerry enter The Party and stand by the door|ELAINE| Well, what are we gonna do for a ride?
George, Elaine and Jerry enter The Party and stand by the door|JERRY| I don't know.
George, Elaine and Jerry enter The Party and stand by the door|ELAINE| You don't know?
George, Elaine and Jerry enter The Party and stand by the door|JERRY| Maybe Kramer can come pick us up.
George, Elaine and Jerry enter The Party and stand by the door|ELAINE| Oh great, oh, this is great.  How could you let him take the car?

Still at the Party|AVA| Are you a vegetarian?
Still at the Party|JERRY| Here we go.
Still at the Party|ELAINE| Yeah, I eat fish occasionally.
Still at the Party|AVA| So you're a hypocrite.
Still at the Party|GEORGE| Hey, I've eaten frogs, so nobody's perfect.  Anyway-
Still at the Party|AVA| Well, talk to me when you stop eating fish.
Still at the Party|ELAINE| Fish don't feel any pain.

Every time I go to the bathroom I pass her desk.  I have to plan little patter. I spend half my day writing.  Then afterwards, I sit in my office and analyze how it went.  If it was a good conversation, I don't go to the bathroom for the rest of the day.  I see her laughing and talking with other people, they're all so loose and relaxed, I think, 'that used to be me.  I want to go back there again.'
Jerry and George are at the drug store.|JERRY| What are you gonna do?
