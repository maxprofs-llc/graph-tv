Jerry's Apartment|GEORGE|Oh. How's she doing?
Jerry's Apartment|action|George rises, and he and Jerry collect their jackets and make their way to the door.
Jerry's Apartment|JERRY|Ah, she's starting to slip a little. Sometimes she has Difficulty distinguishing between the past and the present.
Jerry's Apartment|GEORGE|Ah. You know, there's gotta be an easier way to open ketchups. They should make it in a tube.
Jerry's Apartment|JERRY|Like toothpaste?
Jerry's Apartment|GEORGE|Ya-hah.
Jerry's Apartment|action|Jerry and George leave.
Street|action|Jerry and George stroll along, continuing their conversation.
Street|JERRY|There's a squeeze ketchup.
Street|GEORGE|I've seen squeeze mustard. I've never seen squeeze ketchup.
Street|JERRY|Well, if they make squeeze mustard, doesn't it stand to reason that they make squeeze ketchup?
Street|GEORGE|Not necessarily. Mustard lends itself to the squeeze.
Street|JERRY|I really don't see the difference.
Street|GEORGE|Oh, there's a difference. It's subtle.
Street|JERRY|It's subtle.
Street|GEORGE|Hey uh, isn't Elaine supposed to meet us?

Street|JERRY|Yeah. I'm on a kiss hello program with her.
Street|GEORGE|Really?
Street|JERRY|Yeah. Every time I see her, I gotta kiss her hello. I just did it once, on her birthday, somehow it mushroomed. Now I dread seeing her because of it.
Street|action|Jerry smiles and waves to Elaine, who is approaching with Wendy. Elaine waves back.
Street|ELAINE|(from a distance) Hey.
Street|GEORGE|You know, I'm down to one kiss hello. My aunt Sylvia.
Street|JERRY|Ah, that's fortunate. I really admire that.

Street|JERRY|No, I told you I admire your hearing.
Street|action|George waves away the compliment.
Street|JERRY|No, don't slough that off, you have great hearing.
Street|action|Jerry and George walk and meet Elaine and Wendy. Wendy greets Jerry with a kiss on the cheek, which he's not happy about. Wendy is attractive, but has a real old-fashioned fifties-style hairdo.

Street|action|Wendy and George shake hands.
Street|GEORGE|You're uh, physical therapist, right?

Street|JERRY|Bye.
Street|ELAINE|(slapping George on the arm) What did you do that for?
Street|GEORGE|What?
Street|ELAINE|(pinching George's arm) Ask about your arm.
Monk's|action|George, Jerry and Elaine enter.
Monk's|GEORGE|I still don't see why I can't ask her about my arm.
Monk's|ELAINE|She's a physical therapist. She doesn't want to have to deal with that outside of the office.
Monk's|GEORGE|Why not?
Monk's|action|The trio sit down in a booth.
Monk's|ELAINE|Because, it is what she does.
Monk's|GEORGE|I love these people, you can't ask 'em questions. (getting excited) They're so mentally gifted that we mustn't disturb the delicate genius unless it's in the confines of an office. (worked up) When huge sums of money are involved, then the delicate genius can be disturbed!
Monk's|ELAINE|George, you got a little something, right here.
Monk's|action|Elaine indicates underneath George's nostrils.
Monk's|GEORGE|(wiping the area with a hand) People think they're so important...
Monk's|JERRY|(adamant) Well, I'm going on record right now that that was my last kiss hello. I am getting off the kiss program with her.
Monk's|ELAINE|Why?
Monk's|JERRY|Well, you know, frankly, outside of a sexual relationship, I don't see the point to it. I'm not thrilled with all the handshaking either, but one step at a time.
Monk's|GEORGE|(regarding the menu) What're you getting?
Monk's|JERRY|(to Elaine) And what's with that hairdo, by the way?
Monk's|ELAINE|Huh, yeah, I know. It's not very flattering.
Monk's|JERRY|She looks like something out of an old high school yearbook. You should say something to her.
Monk's|ELAINE|Oh, I could never say anything to her about that.
Monk's|JERRY|Yeah. Kramer's the only person who could say something like that.
Monk's|ELAINE|Yeah. Hah.
Monk's|GEORGE|Well, just tell Kramer to tell her.
Monk's|ELAINE|No. If you tell him to do it, he'll never do it.
Monk's|JERRY|What you have to do is introduce him, and then he'll just come out with it.
Monk's|ELAINE|(sharp intake of breath) Hoh. Yes, yes, you're right. That's right. I'll bring her over to meet...
Monk's|action|Kramer enters.
Monk's|ELAINE|(to Kramer) ...Kramer.

Monk's|JERRY|Why?
Monk's|KRAMER|So everyone will know everybody's name. See, people are gonna be a lot friendlier.
Monk's|JERRY|(reluctant) I, I don't want my picture plastered up in the lobby.
Monk's|KRAMER|Imagine walking by someone on the floor, and you say "Hey, Carl!" and he says "Hey, Jerry!" You see, that's the kind of society I wanna live in.
Monk's|JERRY|(still reluctant) Kramer, I don't wanna stop and talk with everyone, every time I go in the building. I just wanna nod and be on my way.
Monk's|KRAMER|(to Elaine) You know your eyeliner's smudged a little. Why do you wear so much eye makeup?
Monk's|ELAINE|(to Jerry, indicating Kramer) Yeah. This is gonna work out just fine.

Jerry's Apartment|action|The phone rings, and Jerry picks up. Elaine removes her coat.
Jerry's Apartment|JERRY|Hello. Oh, hi mom. Yeah, I was at Nana's yesterday. I had to help her open a ketchup bottle. Hey, mom, let me ask you a question. Do you remember when you were a kid, your father winning like a thousand dollars at the track? (listens) Really? Did you know he gave uncle Leo a hundred dollars, and he was supposed to give you fifty? (listens) How do I know? Because Nana doesn't know what year it is, and she thinks this just happened.

Jerry's Apartment|JERRY|No no, he'll come in. Well, this is gonna be my first opportunity to not kiss her hello.
Jerry's Apartment|ELAINE|What is the big deal about putting your lips on somebody's face?
Jerry's Apartment|JERRY|It's the obligation, you know? As soon as this person comes in, you know you have to do this. I mean, if you could, say, touch a breast as part of the kiss hello, then I think I could see the value in it a little better.
Jerry's Apartment|ELAINE|How 'bout an intercourse hello? How would that be?

Jerry's Apartment|JERRY|Oh, look at that. I'm almost outta Klondike bars.
Jerry's Apartment|action|Jerry peers around the edge of the door, to see if the coast is clear. Finding that it is, he closes the various doors of the fridge.

Wendy's Car|WENDY|Elaine?
Wendy's Car|ELAINE|I'm just thinking about the question.

Jerry's Apartment|KRAMER|For what?
Jerry's Apartment|JERRY|(agitated) For putting my picture up on that wall! I'm like Richard Dawson down there now. And every person I see engages me in this long, boring, tedious, conversation. I can't even get out of the building!
Jerry's Apartment|KRAMER|You should be thanking me for liberating you from your world of loneliness and isolation. Now, you're part of a family.
Jerry's Apartment|JERRY|Family?
Jerry's Apartment|KRAMER|Yeah.
Jerry's Apartment|JERRY|You think I want another family?

And I tell you another thing, Cosmo Kramer, whatever you wanna be called. The kissing thing is over. There's no more kissing, and I don't care what the consequences are.

Street|JERRY|I tell you. If you were hitch-hiking, you'd never get into a car with someone with a hairdo like that.
Street|ELAINE|I had to carry my skis, and my boots and my poles. I think I pinched a nerve in my shoulder.

Street|ELAINE|Yeah, alright, I gotta go.
