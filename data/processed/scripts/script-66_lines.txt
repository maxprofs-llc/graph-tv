Setting: Jerry's apartment|JERRY|I told you I'd lend you the money for the rent.

Setting: The Today Show|JERRY|(Nervous laughter) Yeah.. like a pirate.. (Attempting to get on another subject) Anyway, ah, you know, we're hoping to, um, raise enough money.. with this.. uh..
Setting: The Today Show|BRYANT|(Rudely interrupting, still snickering at the shirt) You.. ah, look, I'm sorry, it is just a VERY unusual shirt. It could be kind of a whole new look for you.. you know, you could put a patch over an eye, you could be kind of like the pirate-comedian.
Setting: The Today Show|JERRY|Uh-huh, yeah. (Smiling, nodding, clearly wanting Bryant to shut up)
Setting: The Today Show|BRYANT|Are you going to be wearing the shirt at the concert?
Setting: The Today Show|JERRY|(Losing it, mad) Look, it's not my shirt.
Setting: The Today Show|BRYANT|(Confused) Whose shirt is it?
Setting: The Today Show|JERRY|What's the difference? I agreed to wear it. It's - it's a puffy shirt. I feel ridiculous in it, and I think it's the stupidest shirt I've ever seen, to be perfectly honest with you. (Nodding)
Setting: The Today Show|LESLIE|(Off camera, shrill, high pitched yelling) You bastard!
Setting: The Today Show|BRYANT|(To Jerry) Did you hear that?
Setting: The Today Show|JERRY|(Pointing off screen, nodding) THAT I heard.

Setting: Photographer's studio|PHOTOGRAPHER|(Instructing George) Alright, a little to the left.. Little higher, little higher. Good. Perfect! Perfect.
Setting: Photographer's studio|GEORGE|Like that?
Setting: Photographer's studio|PHOTOGRAPHER|Just like that. Hold it. (Takes picture) Good, ok, let me get just one more, one more. (Takes another picture) Good, that's it. You're done.
Setting: Photographer's studio|GEORGE|That's it?
Setting: Photographer's studio|PHOTOGRAPHER|(Smiling) That's it.
Setting: Photographer's studio|MAN|(Pulling a slip of paper out of his coat pocket) And here's your check. (George accepts) Thank you very much. (Pats him on the back) It was an honor.
Setting: Photographer's studio|WOMAN|It was great working with you. (Somewhat coy) Your hands are beautiful.
Setting: Photographer's studio|GEORGE|(Modest) Oh, thank you very much. (Chuckles)
Setting: Photographer's studio|WOMAN|You know, I was wondering - if you're not doing anything later, maybe you'd like to get together..?

Setting: Today Show dressing room|action|Jerry, still in the puffy shirt, is getting yelled at by Leslie. Kramer's trying to calm her down, she's hysterical
Setting: Today Show dressing room|LESLIE|You ruined me! You ruined my career!
Setting: Today Show dressing room|JERRY|Oh, just keep your voice down. Everyone can hear you.
Setting: Today Show dressing room|LESLIE|(Shouting out) Oh, I don't give a damn!
Setting: Today Show dressing room|JERRY|(Reasoning) You know, if you talked this loud to begin with, I wouldn't be in this costume in the first place!
Setting: Today Show dressing room|action|Leslie, deeply let down, finds comfort in Kramer as they go back and sit together on a sofa. George enters, ecstatic
Setting: Today Show dressing room|GEORGE|(Quick, excited talking) Hey, hey! You can't believe this. Look at this check! (Hands it to Jerry) They told me I had the most beautiful hands they'd ever seen in their lives - except for this McKigney guy - this great looking girl gave me her phone number.. I got it! I got it all! I'm busting. Jerry, I'm busting!
Setting: Today Show dressing room|ELAINE|Hey, I've never noticed your hands before. Let me see.
Setting: Today Show dressing room|GEORGE|Alright. (Holds them up)
Setting: Today Show dressing room|ELAINE|(Obviously not impressed, dull) Yeah, real nice.
Setting: Today Show dressing room|GEORGE|(Turning back to Jerry, he takes the check back. He just now notices the shirt Jerry's wearing, and snickers, pointing) Nice shirt.. (Laughs, Jerry shrugs) What is this? Is this what you wore on the show?
Setting: Today Show dressing room|action|Leslie is in full attention of what George is saying, quietly steaming
Setting: Today Show dressing room|JERRY|Yeah.
Setting: Today Show dressing room|action|Kramer notices Leslie's state of mind
Setting: Today Show dressing room|GEORGE|What, have you completely lost your mind?
Setting: Today Show dressing room|KRAMER|(Faint, trying to shut George up) Hey..
Setting: Today Show dressing room|GEORGE|Who's dressing you? (Laughs) You look like a complete idiot! You know, I wouldn't wipe my- (Unable to take anymore, Leslie gets up and shoves George violently. His hands go straight for the hot iron sitting on the dressing room table. George screams out in agony) AAHHHH!!!!! (his voice is heard outside the building, on the street, and in the park were a bunch of pigeons are scared by the yelling)

Setting: A Restaurant|ELAINE|You ready?
Setting: A Restaurant|action|George nods. She holds the cup up to his mouth, he takes a sip
Setting: A Restaurant|GEORGE|Ow! Hot! Hot!
Setting: A Restaurant|ELAINE|(Sincere) I'm sorry.
Setting: A Restaurant|GEORGE|(Reflecting on his life gone wrong) This McKigney guy had a few good years.. (To Kramer, bitter) How could you forget to turn off an iron?
Setting: A Restaurant|KRAMER|Well, I was excited because Jerry was putting on the puffy shirt.
Setting: A Restaurant|GEORGE|My whole life is ruined because of the (Mocking, bitter tone) "puffy shirt".
Setting: A Restaurant|JERRY|(Pointing out) It didn't do me any good either! That benefit was the worst show I ever did. Some of those heckles were really uncalled for: "Avast ye matey" - what the hell does that mean?! "20 degrees off the starboard side - the Spanish Galleon!" - there's no comeback for that!
Setting: A Restaurant|ELAINE|(Reflecting) Well, it got me fired from the benefit committee.
Setting: A Restaurant|KRAMER|You know all those stores canceled out on her? She's finished. (Concluding) We're (Leslie and him) finished.
Setting: A Restaurant|JERRY|Really? What happened?
Setting: A Restaurant|KRAMER|(Showing pure irony) I just can't be with someone who's life is in complete disarray.
Setting: A Restaurant|JERRY|What happened with all the shirts?
Setting: A Restaurant|KRAMER|They gave them all to Goodwill.
Setting: A Restaurant|action|Finished, they all exit the cafe. George is muttering "puffy shirt.. puffy shirt.." as they meet up with two homeless men dressed in the puffy shirts with their hands out - begging for some change. George shows his two bandaged hands, then walks off with Elaine
Setting: A Restaurant|JERRY|(While digging in his pocket for some money, he looks over the shirts one last time) You know, it's really not a bad looking shirt..
