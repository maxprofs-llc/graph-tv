New scene - Jerry and Elaine in Jerry's apartment. Jerry is on the phone with Tim Whatley.|GEORGE|What Consumer? I'm the consumer.
New scene - Jerry and Elaine in Jerry's apartment. Jerry is on the phone with Tim Whatley.|JERRY|Alright. Seems like...a strange choice.
New scene - Jerry and Elaine in Jerry's apartment. Jerry is on the phone with Tim Whatley.|GEORGE|Well, maybe so...but it was good enough for Mr. Jon Voight.
New scene - Jerry and Elaine in Jerry's apartment. Jerry is on the phone with Tim Whatley.|ELAINE|Jon Voight? The actor?
New scene - Jerry and Elaine in Jerry's apartment. Jerry is on the phone with Tim Whatley.|JERRY|You bought a car because it belonged to Jon Voight?
New scene - Jerry and Elaine in Jerry's apartment. Jerry is on the phone with Tim Whatley.|JERRY|I think yes, yes. You like the idea of telling people you're driving Jon Voight's car.
New scene - Jerry and Elaine in Jerry's apartment. Jerry is on the phone with Tim Whatley.|GEORGE|Alright, maybe I do. So what.
New scene - Jerry and Elaine in Jerry's apartment. Jerry is on the phone with Tim Whatley.|ELAINE|I've never even seen him in a car. I mean, look at his movies. No cars. Deliverance - canoe. Midnight Cowboy - boots. Runaway Train...runaway train. (Kramer enters.)

New scene - Jerry and Elaine in Jerry's apartment. Jerry is on the phone with Tim Whatley.|ELAINE|I like coffee.
New scene - Jerry and Elaine in Jerry's apartment. Jerry is on the phone with Tim Whatley.|GEORGE|I like (imitates Kramer) "cookies."
New scene - Jerry and Elaine in Jerry's apartment. Jerry is on the phone with Tim Whatley.|KRAMER|Yeah, of course you do. And do you know why? Because you're a bunch of yuppies. It's your go-go corporate takeover lifestyles that are driving out these Mom and Pop stores and destroying the fabric of this neighborhood.
New scene - Jerry and Elaine in Jerry's apartment. Jerry is on the phone with Tim Whatley.|GEORGE|Well, what's so great about a Mom and Pop store? Let me tell you something. If my Mom and Pop ran a store, I wouldn't shop there.
New scene - Jerry and Elaine in Jerry's apartment. Jerry is on the phone with Tim Whatley.|KRAMER|Hey, Bogambo - they've been in the neighborhood for 48 years. Now, come on, Jerry. You've gotta have a pair of shoes in need of a cobblin.'

New scene - Kramer dropping off a box full of Jerry's sneakers at Mom and Pop's shoe repair shop.|POP|What?
New scene - Kramer dropping off a box full of Jerry's sneakers at Mom and Pop's shoe repair shop.|POP|You know, in the 48 years we've been here, I don't think we've ever called an electrician.
New scene - Kramer dropping off a box full of Jerry's sneakers at Mom and Pop's shoe repair shop.|KRAMER|Yeah well, you should. This place could blow any minute.

New scene - Jerry and George walking down the street toward George's new car.|JERRY|I like Jon Voight. Just seems like kind've a strange reason to buy a car, because he might have driven it.
New scene - Jerry and George walking down the street toward George's new car.|GEORGE|What do you mean "might"? You don't think he really owned this car?
New scene - Jerry and George walking down the street toward George's new car.|JERRY|I don't know.
New scene - Jerry and George walking down the street toward George's new car.|GEORGE|Well, why would the guy make up something like that? Of all the names he could pick, why settle on Jon Voight?
New scene - Jerry and George walking down the street toward George's new car.|JERRY|Don't you see, that's the genius of it. If he had said Liam Neeson, you'd know he's making it up.
New scene - Jerry and George walking down the street toward George's new car.|GEORGE|Neeson? How are you comparing Liam Neeson with Jon Voight? Jerry, we're talking about Joe Buck. If you can play Joe Buck, Oskar Schindler's a cake walk. (Opens the car door for Jerry, Jerry's about to get in.)
New scene - Jerry and George walking down the street toward George's new car.|JERRY|Oh, look at this, I stepped in gum.

New scene - Jerry and George walking down the street toward George's new car.|KRAMER|You said take 'em.
New scene - Jerry and George walking down the street toward George's new car.|JERRY|Not all of 'em!
New scene - Jerry and George walking down the street toward George's new car.|KRAMER|Well, obviously there was a miscommunication.
New scene - Jerry and George walking down the street toward George's new car.|JERRY|Obviously. So what am I supposed to wear?
New scene - Jerry and George walking down the street toward George's new car.|KRAMER|Jerry, I left you a pair right here...(goes into Jerry's room and comes out with a pair of cowboy boots.) C'mon. There, put on those boots.
New scene - Jerry and George walking down the street toward George's new car.|JERRY|I can't wear these!
New scene - Jerry and George walking down the street toward George's new car.|KRAMER|Well, why not?
New scene - Jerry and George walking down the street toward George's new car.|JERRY|They're uncomfortable.
New scene - Jerry and George walking down the street toward George's new car.|KRAMER|C'mon here, try 'em on. (Jerry sits down and puts the boots on.)
New scene - Jerry and George walking down the street toward George's new car.|GEORGE|Where did you get those?
New scene - Jerry and George walking down the street toward George's new car.|JERRY|I worked a club in Dallas one time and they couldn't afford to pay me so they gave me these. Oh, I can't wear these! (Stands up.) They look ridiculous!
New scene - Jerry and George walking down the street toward George's new car.|KRAMER|Ah, you look like a cowboy! Huh?
New scene - Jerry and George walking down the street toward George's new car.|JERRY|But I don't wanna be a cowboy!
New scene - Jerry and George walking down the street toward George's new car.|KRAMER|Oh, stop it. You know that friend of yours, Tim the dentist? I got an invitation to his Thanksgiving Eve party.
New scene - Jerry and George walking down the street toward George's new car.|GEORGE|Yeah, I got one too.
New scene - Jerry and George walking down the street toward George's new car.|KRAMER|Yeah?
New scene - Jerry and George walking down the street toward George's new car.|JERRY|Oh yeah? Huh.
New scene - Jerry and George walking down the street toward George's new car.|GEORGE|What?
New scene - Jerry and George walking down the street toward George's new car.|JERRY|No, nothing.
New scene - Jerry and George walking down the street toward George's new car.|GEORGE|No, what is it?
New scene - Jerry and George walking down the street toward George's new car.|JERRY|No, it's just that I, uh...didn't get one.
New scene - Jerry and George walking down the street toward George's new car.|GEORGE|You didn't get one?
New scene - Jerry and George walking down the street toward George's new car.|JERRY|Ah, but he called me up and he asked for yours and Elaine's addresses, I'm sure that means I'm invited.
New scene - Jerry and George walking down the street toward George's new car.|KRAMER|Not necessarily.
New scene - Jerry and George walking down the street toward George's new car.|JERRY|Hey, why would you call someone up and ask them for two addresses if you're not invited to the party?
New scene - Mom and Pop talking to the electrician about the faulty wiring in the ceiling of the shop.|POP|Four thousand dollars? We can't afford that!
New scene - Mom and Pop talking to the electrician about the faulty wiring in the ceiling of the shop.|ELECTRICIAN|Well I'm afraid you're gonna have to do something about it, because it's in violation of the building code. Otherwise, they're gonna close you up.
New scene - Mom and Pop talking to the electrician about the faulty wiring in the ceiling of the shop.|POP|But what if we can't pay for it?
New scene - Mom and Pop talking to the electrician about the faulty wiring in the ceiling of the shop.|ELECTRICIAN|Then I have to report you. Otherwise, I lose my license. Sorry. (Exits.)
New scene - Mom and Pop talking to the electrician about the faulty wiring in the ceiling of the shop.|POP|48 years, Mom! And now we have to close! All because of that idiot and his bloody nose! (Kramer enters.)

New scene - George and Jerry driving along in John Voight's car. George is humming the tune to "Everybody's Talkin.'"|GEORGE|Ah! See? I told ya.
New scene - George and Jerry driving along in John Voight's car. George is humming the tune to "Everybody's Talkin.'"|JERRY|Except Jon is spelled with an H. J-O-H-N.
New scene - George and Jerry driving along in John Voight's car. George is humming the tune to "Everybody's Talkin.'"|GEORGE|So?
New scene - George and Jerry driving along in John Voight's car. George is humming the tune to "Everybody's Talkin.'"|JERRY|Doesn't Jon Voight spell his name J-O-N?
New scene - George and Jerry driving along in John Voight's car. George is humming the tune to "Everybody's Talkin.'"|JERRY|Nothing. I'm sure "Jon" probably mispelled his own name. I know sometimes I spell Jerry with a G...and an I! (Laughs uproariously.)
New scene - George and Jerry driving along in John Voight's car. George is humming the tune to "Everybody's Talkin.'"|JERRY|What?
New scene - George and Jerry driving along in John Voight's car. George is humming the tune to "Everybody's Talkin.'"|GEORGE|That's right, you heard me. Get out! You are ruining this whole experience for me!

New scene - Jerry, George and Elaine at Jerry's apartment.|JERRY|No, they didn't even touch me. I tripped because of these stupid cowboy boots.
New scene - Jerry, George and Elaine at Jerry's apartment.|GEORGE|Anyway, again, I'm sorry about throwing you out of the car.
New scene - Jerry, George and Elaine at Jerry's apartment.|JERRY|You really seemed to enjoy it.
New scene - Jerry, George and Elaine at Jerry's apartment.|GEORGE|It was kinda fun. (Elaine gives Jerry a cold cloth for his jaw.) You know, maybe his name really is J-O-H-N, but he changed it to J-O-N for show business. Well, you know, J-O-N is a lot zippier.
New scene - Jerry, George and Elaine at Jerry's apartment.|GEORGE|How would you find out something like that...wait a minute, what am I thinking? I've got the entire Yankee organization at my disposal.
New scene - Jerry, George and Elaine at Jerry's apartment.|GEORGE|Heh, that's right. See ya later. (Exits.)
New scene - Jerry, George and Elaine at Jerry's apartment.|ELAINE|So Jerome, I did a little snooping around for you.
New scene - Jerry, George and Elaine at Jerry's apartment.|JERRY|Ah! What'd you find out, Lois?
New scene - Jerry, George and Elaine at Jerry's apartment.|ELAINE|Well, I talked to Tim Whatley...
New scene - Jerry, George and Elaine at Jerry's apartment.|JERRY|Yeah...
New scene - Jerry, George and Elaine at Jerry's apartment.|ELAINE|And I asked him, "Should Jerry bring anything?"
New scene - Jerry, George and Elaine at Jerry's apartment.|JERRY|So...?
New scene - Jerry, George and Elaine at Jerry's apartment.|ELAINE|Mmmm...and he said, "Why would Jerry bring anything?"
New scene - Jerry, George and Elaine at Jerry's apartment.|JERRY|Alright, but let me ask you this question.
New scene - Jerry, George and Elaine at Jerry's apartment.|ELAINE|What?
New scene - Jerry, George and Elaine at Jerry's apartment.|JERRY|Which word did he emphasize? Did he say, "Why would Jerry bring anything?" or, "Why would Jerry bring anything?" You emphasize "Jerry" or "bring."
New scene - Jerry, George and Elaine at Jerry's apartment.|ELAINE|I think he emphasized "would."
New scene - Jerry, George and Elaine at Jerry's apartment.|JERRY|You know what? The hell with this party, I don't even want to go to begin with. (Kramer enters.)
New scene - Jerry, George and Elaine at Jerry's apartment.|KRAMER|Hey.
New scene - Jerry, George and Elaine at Jerry's apartment.|JERRY|Hey, so where's my sneakers?
New scene - Jerry, George and Elaine at Jerry's apartment.|KRAMER|That's what I wanna know.
New scene - Jerry, George and Elaine at Jerry's apartment.|JERRY|What do you mean?
New scene - Jerry, George and Elaine at Jerry's apartment.|KRAMER|Well, I saw Mom and Pop this morning, but when I went by the store on my way home? The place was empty. Everything is gone. Mom and Pop - vrooop - vanished.
New scene - Jerry, George and Elaine at Jerry's apartment.|JERRY|So all my sneakers are gone?
New scene - Jerry, George and Elaine at Jerry's apartment.|KRAMER|I'm afraid so. And that's just the tip of the iceberg. I've been asking around - they didn't even have any kids.
New scene - Jerry, George and Elaine at Jerry's apartment.|JERRY|Mom and Pop aren't even a Mom and Pop?!
New scene - Jerry, George and Elaine at Jerry's apartment.|KRAMER|It was all an act, Jerry. They conned us, and they scored, big time.
New scene - Jerry, George and Elaine at Jerry's apartment.|KRAMER|Apparently.
New scene - Jerry, George and Elaine at Jerry's apartment.|ELAINE|Alright, that's enough of this.
New scene - Jerry, George and Elaine at Jerry's apartment.|JERRY|Where ya goin'?
New scene - Jerry, George and Elaine at Jerry's apartment.|ELAINE|I gotta go to the Dixieland Deli to pick up Mr. Pitt's security pass for the parade.
New scene - Jerry, George and Elaine at Jerry's apartment.|JERRY|Why does he want to hold a rope underneath Woody Woodpecker in the Thanksgiving Day Parade?
New scene - Jerry, George and Elaine at Jerry's apartment.|ELAINE|He finds his laugh "intoxicating." (Laughs like Woody Woodpecker, and exits.)
New scene - George in a meeting at Yankee stadium.|GEORGE|Well, I think we need more special days at the stadium, you know? Like, uh...Joe Pepitone Day. Or, uh...Jon Voight Day.
New scene - George in a meeting at Yankee stadium.|GEORGE|I suppose if I had suggested Liam Neeson Day, you'd all be patting me on the back.
New scene - Elaine at the Dixieland Deli, seated at a table with the other contest winners.|ELAINE|Um, it was, uh..."Next Stop Pottersville." (The group is unimpressed.) Uh, do you know when they're giving out the passes?

The cab speeds off leaving Kramer in the street, stunned.)
New scene - Jerry and George in Jerry's apartment.|JERRY|No Jon Voight Day, huh?
New scene - Jerry and George in Jerry's apartment.|GEORGE|No. Now I'll always have this doubt about the car. What, your jaw still hurts?
New scene - Jerry and George in Jerry's apartment.|JERRY|Yeah, it's all swollen. I think I may have chipped a tooth when I fell yesterday.
New scene - Jerry and George in Jerry's apartment.|GEORGE|You should have somebody take a look at that.
New scene - Jerry and George in Jerry's apartment.|JERRY|I'm calling dentists all day here, there's nobody working the day before Thanksgiving.
New scene - Jerry and George in Jerry's apartment.|GEORGE|You going to the party?
New scene - Jerry and George in Jerry's apartment.|JERRY|No, I don't know if I'm invited.
New scene - Jerry and George in Jerry's apartment.|GEORGE|Well, there's going to be a lot of dentists there.
New scene - Jerry and George in Jerry's apartment.|JERRY|Yeah, you're right.
New scene - Jerry and George in Jerry's apartment.|GEORGE|You don't want to suffer with this all weekend.
New scene - Jerry and George in Jerry's apartment.|JERRY|Yeah, I gotta see a dentist, this is killin' me. Well, I'll take a chance. We'll go together.
New scene - Jerry and George in Jerry's apartment.|GEORGE|Maybe I'll just meet you there.
New scene - Jerry and George in Jerry's apartment.|JERRY|You don't want to go with me?
New scene - Jerry and George in Jerry's apartment.|GEORGE|Jerry, for all I know this guy went out of his way to not invite you. How am I gonna feel if I show up with an uninvited, unwelcome intruder?
New scene - Jerry and George in Jerry's apartment.|JERRY|The way I feel when I go places with you? (Kramer enters.) Hey, so'd you find my sneakers yet?
New scene - Jerry and George in Jerry's apartment.|KRAMER|No. (To George) But I did run into somebody you might be interested in, a Mr. Jon Voight, the actor?
New scene - Jerry and George in Jerry's apartment.|GEORGE|Jon Voight! Are you kiddin' me? Did you talk to him?
New scene - Jerry and George in Jerry's apartment.|KRAMER|Well, he was a little standoffish.
New scene - Jerry and George in Jerry's apartment.|GEORGE|What, you didn't ask him about the car?
New scene - Jerry and George in Jerry's apartment.|KRAMER|No, I couldn't, his cab pulled away. But he did, however, make an impression on me. (Pulls up his sleeve and shows George his arm.) Look.
New scene - Jerry and George in Jerry's apartment.|JERRY|What?
New scene - Jerry and George in Jerry's apartment.|KRAMER|His tooth marks. He bit me.
New scene - Jerry and George in Jerry's apartment.|GEORGE|Jon Voight bit you?
New scene - Jerry and George in Jerry's apartment.|JERRY|Well, what is he, a vampire?
New scene - Jerry and George in Jerry's apartment.|KRAMER|No, it's justifiable. He thought I was going for his wallet.
New scene - Jerry and George in Jerry's apartment.|KRAMER|That he did. Now, you got that pencil with the bite marks on it? We get a trained eye to match 'em up, and we'll see whether or not you're driving Jon Voight's car!
New scene - Jerry and George in Jerry's apartment.|JERRY|Oh, please.
New scene - Jerry and George in Jerry's apartment.|GEORGE|Wait a minute, wait, it's not that stupid.
New scene - Jerry and George in Jerry's apartment.|JERRY|No, it's stupid.
New scene - Jerry and George in Jerry's apartment.|GEORGE|Why? Why isn't it possible? I mean, they're both bite marks.
New scene - Jerry and George in Jerry's apartment.|JERRY|So you're gonna show up at that party with a chewed-up pencil and Kramer's gnarled arm.
New scene - Jerry and George in Jerry's apartment.|GEORGE|It's worth a shot. (Goes to the door.)
New scene - Jerry and George in Jerry's apartment.|JERRY|So, Kramer, you wanna go to the party together?
New scene - Jerry and George in Jerry's apartment.|KRAMER|Jerry, look, come on, I'm an invited guest. I can't be aiding and abetting some...party-crasher.

New scene - Tim Whatley's party. Jerry peeks his head around the corner, then slowly moves through the crowd, covering his face to keep a low profile.|ELAINE|What? I can't hear a word you're saying. I was stuck at the Dixieland Deli all day. My head is still ringing. Where's Tim?
New scene - Tim Whatley's party. Jerry peeks his head around the corner, then slowly moves through the crowd, covering his face to keep a low profile.|ELAINE|What? I can't hear you.
