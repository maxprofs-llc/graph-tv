Scene: In the Play Now office|THOMASSOULO|George, you’re not really handicapped, are you?
Scene: In the Play Now office|GEORGE|I’ve had my difficulties.
Scene: In the Play Now office|THOMASSOULO|I saw you running down Amsterdam Avenue lifting that 200 pound motorized cart with one hand.
Scene: In the Play Now office|GEORGE|Mr. Thomassoulo during times of great stress, people are capable of super human strength. Have you ever seen the Incredible Hulk, sir?
Scene: In the Play Now office|THOMASSOULO|No
Scene: In the Play Now office|GEORGE|How about the old Spider Man live action show?
Scene: In the Play Now office|THOMASSOULO|George, I’ve realized we’ve signed a one-year contract with you, but at this point I think it’s best that we both go our separate ways.
Scene: In the Play Now office|GEORGE|I don’t understand.
Scene: In the Play Now office|THOMASSOULO|We don’t like you. We want you to leave.
Scene: In the Play Now office|GEORGE|Clearer
Scene: At Monks Café|JERRY|So you’re staying at Play Now?
Scene: At Monks Café|GEORGE|Why not? Pay is good. I got dental, private access to one of the great handicapped toilets in the city.
Scene: At Monks Café|JERRY|But they not you aren’t handicapped, aren’t you ashamed?
Scene: At Monks Café|GEORGE|They’re the ones who should be ashamed. They signed me to a one-year contract. As long as I show up for work every day, they have to pay me.
Scene: At Monks Café|action|Elaine walks in
Scene: At Monks Café|ELAINE|Hey
Scene: At Monks Café|GEORGE|Hello-o-o-o Elaine!
Scene: At Monks Café|ELAINE|What’s that?
Scene: At Monks Café|JERRY|Oh, it’s just this stupid thing.
Scene: At Monks Café|ELAINE|Well, I’m sure it’s stupid. It’s not about me, is it?
Scene: At Monks Café|JERRY|(doing the voice) No-o-o-o.
Scene: At Monks Café|GEORGE|(doing the voice) Not at all.
Scene: At Monks Café|ELAINE|Tell me!
Scene: At Monks Café|JERRY|All right. You know this girl Clare I am seeing?
Scene: At Monks Café|ELAINE|Yeah.
Scene: At Monks Café|JERRY|Well, he and I starting joking that when she falls asleep her stomach stays awake all night and talks to me.
Scene: At Monks Café|ELAINE|How is it talking?
Scene: At Monks Café|JERRY|Well, her belly button is like a mouth. (doing the voice) I’m bored. Talk to me.
Scene: At Monks Café|ELAINE|Oh I gotta start taking these "stupid" warnings more seriously.
Scene: At Monks Café|action|Puddy walks in
Scene: At Monks Café|JERRY|Hey, look whose here - Puddy.
Scene: At Monks Café|ELAINE|My Puddy? But we broke up.
Scene: At Monks Café|JERRY|And yet he continues to live.
Scene: At Monks Café|action|Puddy walks over to the table
Scene: At Monks Café|PUDDY|Hey Benes, How are you?
Scene: At Monks Café|ELAINE|I’m doing great.
Scene: At Monks Café|PUDDY|Great. (pauses) See ya.
Scene: At Monks Café|JERRY|Well, that’s it. You two are back together.
Scene: At Monks Café|ELAINE|What?
Scene: At Monks Café|JERRY|The bump into. The bump into always leads to the backslide.
Scene: At Monks Café|ELAINE|David and I will not be getting back together.
Scene: At Monks Café|JERRY|Elaine, breaking up is like knocking over a coke machine. You can’t do it in one push, you got to rock it back and forth a few times, and then it goes over.
Scene: At Monks Café|GEORGE|That’s beautiful.
Scene: At Monks Café|ELAINE|What about you? You were even engaged, and you cut it off just like that.
Scene: At Monks Café|JERRY|That’s different. I didn’t have feelings for those people. But you, you’ll backslide
Scene: At Monks Café|ELAINE|You want to bet?
Scene: At Monks Café|JERRY|Stakes?
Scene: At Monks Café|ELAINE|50
Scene: At Monks Café|JERRY|Dollars?
Scene: At Monks Café|ELAINE|All right. Witness? (looks at George).
Scene: At Monks Café|GEORGE|Witness.
Scene: At Monks Café|JERRY|Done.
Scene: At Monks Café|GEORGE|Percentage?
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment|CLARE|So I’ll call you tonight?
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment|JERRY|Yeah.
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment|CLARE|What’s wrong with the belt?
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment|JERRY|I went to the movies last night, I went to the bathroom and I unbuckled a little wobbly and the buckle kind of banged against the side of the urinal. So…(throws away belt) that’s it!
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment|CLARE|So, you’re insane?
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment|JERRY|Oh yes, quite.
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment|action|Kramer walks in
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment|KRAMER|Hello!
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment|JERRY|Of course it’s a sliding scale.
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment|CLARE|Catch you later.
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment|JERRY|(doing the voice) La la la.
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment|KRAMER|(doing the voice) La la la.
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment|action|Kramer is reading the newspaper at the table
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment|KRAMER|Look at this, they are redoing the Cloud Club.
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment|JERRY|Oh, that restaurant on top of the Chrysler building? Yeah, that’s a good idea.
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment|KRAMER|Of course it’s a good idea, it’s my idea. I conceived this whole project two years ago.
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment|JERRY|Which part? The renovating the restaurant you don’t own part or spending the two hundred million you don’t have part?
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment|KRAMER|You see I come up with these things, I know they’re gold, but nothing happens. You know why?
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment|JERRY|No resources, no skill, no talent, no ability, no brains.
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment|KRAMER|(interrupts) No, no…time! It’s all this meaningless time. Laundry, grocery, shopping, coming in here talking to you. Do you have any idea how much time I waste in this apartment?
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment|JERRY|I can ball park it.
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment|action|Elaine walks in – how did she come up without the buzzer?
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment|ELAINE|(doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o!
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment|KRAMER|Here we go; now she comes in. Now my whole day is shot!
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment|JERRY|Hey, I called you last night, where were you?
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment|ELAINE|(looking VERY guilty) I went out with a (fake cough) a friend.
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment|JERRY|George?
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment|ELAINE|(looking guiltier) No, no…no.
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment|JERRY|Well, I was here, that’s everyone (laughing).
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment|ELAINE|(laughing).
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment|JERRY|Are those the same shoes as yesterday?
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment|ELAINE|Oh, you know I wear these shoes all the time.
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment|JERRY|Your hair, it’s somewhat de-poofed.
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment|ELAINE|It’s the new look. You know Heroin Cheek?
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment|JERRY|Wait a second, what’s going on here?
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment|ELAINE|Nothing, nothing.
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment|JERRY|(screams).
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment|ELAINE|(screams).
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment|JERRY|You’re wearing the same clothes as yesterday!!! (pauses) You saw Puddy!
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment|KRAMER|Hoochie moochie. (haha)
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment|JERRY|Hand it over. Pay up.
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment|ELAINE|No! It’s an isolated, sexual incident. We are not back together!
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment|JERRY|Then what do you call it? People don’t just bump into each other and have sex. This isn’t cinemax.
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment|ELAINE|It was no big deal OK? I mean we fooled around, then we went out and grabbed a little dinner.
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment|JERRY|Ah, dinner! That’s it, you’re all the way back!
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment|ELAINE|Ugh!
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment|JERRY|Sex, that’s meaningless, I can understand that, but dinner; that’s heavy. That’s like an hour.
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment|KRAMER|(still reading the paper) Man, 2.9 percent financing on a Toyota Onedun (Sp?). That was my idea too!
Scene: At Play Now|GEORGE|Good Morning!
Scene: At Play Now|GEORGE|Hi Allison, that’s a nice dress.
Scene: At Play Now|ALLISON|Don’t even look at me.
Scene: At Play Now|GEORGE|Hey Glenn!
Scene: At Play Now|GLENN|Hey, go tell hell!
Scene: At Play Now|GEORGE|Heard that one already.
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment|action|Jerry walks in. Kramer is showing his "intern," Darren around
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment|KRAMER|…So that’s the bedroom. Here’s the bathroom. If you need to, you can familiarize yourself with the kitchen…Yeah, go ahead and look through some of the drawers.
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment|JERRY|And you are?
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment|DARREN|Oh, hey, I’m Darren. I’m new here.
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment|KRAMER|Yeah, that’s Jerry, you don’t have to worry about him. Why don’t you go across the hall and get started on that mail.
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment|DARREN|Right!
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment|KRAMER|He’s a go getter!
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment|JERRY|Who’s he?
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment|KRAMER|My intern from NYU. Well, you remember my corporation, Kramerica Industries.
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment|JERRY|Alright.
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment|KRAMER|Well, apparently NYU is very enthusiastic about their students getting some real world corporate experience.
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment|JERRY|But you only provide fantasy world corporate experience.
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment|KRAMER|Well, this will really free up my time so I can focus on more important things, like my bladder system.
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment|JERRY|Alright, it’s time to go.
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment|KRAMER|Jerry, it’s not for people, it’s for oil tankers.
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment|JERRY|(sarcastically) I know!
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment|action|Jerry tries to shove Kramer out the door
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment|KRAMER|You see the idea is for a rubber ball inside the tanker so if it crashes, the oil won’t spill out.
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment|JERRY|Actually, that is not a bad idea.
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment|KRAMER|(smiles) yeah.
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment|JERRY|Now, it’s time to go.
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment|action|slams door
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment|action|phone rings
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment|JERRY|Hello

Scene: At Jerry’s apartment|JERRY|(doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o. (pauses) So, what’s going on?
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment|GEORGE|Siege mentality, Jerry. They really want me out of here. They’ve downgraded me to some sort of a bunker. I’m like Hitler’s last days here.
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment|JERRY|So, are you going to leave?
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment|GEORGE|Oh no! I’m vigilant. They’ll never get me out. I’m like a weed, Jerry.
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment|JERRY|I thought you’re like Hitler in the bunker?
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment|GEORGE|I’m a weed in Hitler’s bunker.
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment|JERRY|I’m getting a little uncomfortable with the Hitler stuff. (his other line beeps) I’m getting another call, see ya…(answers call) Hello!

Scene: At Jerry’s apartment|action|Elaine walks in – again, how did she get up without the buzzer?
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment|ELAINE|Hey!
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment|JERRY|Hey! So, where’s my money?
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment|ELAINE|No money, I am Puddy free. So, are we eating or what?

Scene: At Jerry’s apartment|action|Jerry calls Kramer and Darren answers
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment|JERRY|Hello Darren, this is Jerry from Jerry’s office. (Elaine is looking confused). We’re going to be three for lunch. (Elaine is still looking confused) What do you mean he’s already left?
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment|action|Kramer walks in
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment|JERRY|Hey, Elaine is going to come with us, alright?
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment|KRAMER|What? When did this happen?
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment|JERRY|Well, just…
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment|KRAMER|(yelling) DARREN!
Scene: At Elaine’s apartment|action|Sitting on the couch thinking to herself
Scene: At Elaine’s apartment|ELAINE|I am not calling Puddy. What did I do with my gloves? Oh, I bet I left them over at Puddy’s. I should call him. I need those gloves. No, I better not. I’ll call. (looks at table) Oh, look at that! There are the gloves. I was just about to call. There they are. That’s funny. That’s really funny. That’s really really funny. You know who loves funny stories, David Puddy. (Picks up phone).
Scene: At Monk’s Cafe|GEORGE|Well, Play Now is through playing. They turned the heat way up in my office. They tried to sweat me out.
Scene: At Monk’s Cafe|JERRY|Do you have to write all this stuff down.
Scene: At Monk’s Cafe|DARREN|Well, Mr. Kramer is in a meeting with Mr. Lohmase and he didn’t want to miss anything.
Scene: At Monk’s Cafe|JERRY|So, how hot did it get?
Scene: At Monk’s Cafe|GEORGE|I don’t know, 120, 130…Then they sent some guys to sandblast for 6 hours. Tomorrow they are putting in asbestos.
Scene: At Monk’s Cafe|JERRY|I guess you can take anything, but actual work.
Scene: At Monk’s Cafe|GEORGE|Bring it on!
Scene: At Monk’s Cafe|action|Kramer walks in
Scene: At Monk’s Cafe|GEORGE|(doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o Kramer!
Scene: At Monk’s Cafe|JERRY|(doing the voice) Wel-l-l-c-o-m-e!
Scene: At Monk’s Cafe|GEORGE|(doing the voice) La la la.
Scene: At Monk’s Cafe|KRAMER|Sorry I couldn’t get out of there, what did I miss? (asking his "intern")
Scene: At Monk’s Cafe|DARREN|Well, after ordering, Mr. Seinfeld and Mr. Costanza debated on whether or not iron man wore some sort under garment between his skin and his iron suit…
Scene: At Monk’s Cafe|KRAMER|Uh huh…
Scene: At Monk’s Cafe|GEORGE|(Interrupts) And I still say he’s naked under there!
Scene: At Monk’s Cafe|JERRY|Oh that makes a lot of sense.
Scene: At Monk’s Cafe|GEORGE|Oh, shut up!
Scene: At Monk’s Cafe|DARREN|…Then Mr. Seinfeld went to the restroom, at which point Mr. Costanza scooped ice out of Mr. Seinfeld’s drink with his bare hands using it to wash up (Jerry is taking a sip of water and looking mad) then Mr. Costanza remarked to me, "This never happened." (Jerry then spits out the water).
Scene: At Monk’s Cafe|action|George is looking pissed off
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment in his bed|JERRY|(giggling)
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment in his bed|CLARE|What’s so funny?

Scene: At Jerry’s apartment in his bed|CLARE|What are you laughing about? Tell me.
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment in his bed|JERRY|Oh all right, this is really dumb, really stupid. We’ve been doing this silly, dumb voice.
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment in his bed|action|Clare storms out of the room mad!
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment in his bed|CLARE|So is it fun humiliating me?
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment in his bed|JERRY|No, it’s not you. It’s your stomach, he’s taking with this funny, booming, jovial voice. (doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o.
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment in his bed|CLARE|So you think I’m fat?
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment in his bed|JERRY|No it’s…

Scene: At Jerry’s apartment in his bed|DARREN|Mr. Kramer says, "hey buddy!"
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment in his bed|JERRY|Hey, we’re kind of in the middle of something here. Would you mind coming back later?
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment in his bed|DARREN|Oh yeah sure, sure. Should we set something up now?
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment in his bed|JERRY|(Screams) GET OUT!
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment in his bed|CLARE|I’m leaving too.
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment in his bed|JERRY|No body said you’re fat. He’s a loving character, like the Kool-ade guy.
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment in his bed|CLARE|He is fat!
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment in his bed|JERRY|No, he’s just a little bloated.
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment in his bed|CLARE|Good-bye!

Scene: At Jerry’s apartment in his bed|KRAMER|Yeah, your phone is line one.
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment in his bed|JERRY|Oh…
Scene: At Elaine’s apartment|PUDDY|So the gloves were right by the phone. That is pretty funny.
Scene: At Elaine’s apartment|ELAINE|See, this is what Jerry’s doesn’t understand. We can see each other. We can see each other every day, but it doesn’t mean we are back together.
Scene: At Elaine’s apartment|PUDDY|I mean I love just seeing you and having sex.
Scene: At Elaine’s apartment|ELAINE|Yeah.
Scene: At Elaine’s apartment|PUDDY|Not having to do all that…you know…work.
Scene: At Elaine’s apartment|ELAINE|Well, either way…
Scene: At Elaine’s apartment|PUDDY|All that calling you, and buying you stuff…
Scene: At Elaine’s apartment|ELAINE|David…
Scene: At Elaine’s apartment|PUDDY|Caring about how everyone at work isn’t as smart as you. It’s brutal.
Scene: At Elaine’s apartment|ELAINE|Alright that’s it! We’re back together!
Scene: At Elaine’s apartment|PUDDY|Oh, no.
Scene: At Elaine’s apartment|ELAINE|Oh, yeah.
Scene: At Elaine’s apartment|PUDDY|Look Elaine, be reasonable.

Scene: At NYU|KRAMER|Dean Jones, you wanting to talk to me?
Scene: At NYU|KRAMER|…Yeah.
Scene: At NYU|KRAMER|I know it sounds pretty glamorous, but it’s business as usual at Kramerica.
Scene: At NYU|KRAMER|And with Darren’s help, we’ll get that chicken.
Scene: At NYU|KRAMER|Well, I have to say this seems capricious and arbitrary.
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment|action|Jerry & Clare are talking by the doorway
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment|JERRY|So you’re sure you’re not still angry about last night?
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment|CLARE|No, I’m fine. Just as long as you don’t ever do that voice again.
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment|JERRY|Never?
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment|CLARE|Never.
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment|JERRY|What about if you’re not around?
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment|CLARE|No!
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment|JERRY|So I have to choose between seeing you and doing the voice?
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment|CLARE|That’s right.
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment|JERRY|I can do that.
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment|CLARE|So what’s your decision?
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment|JERRY|I don’t know.
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment|action|At the dock or beach
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment|action|Jerry is thinking to himself – looking quite funny
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment|action|He’s thinking about all the times him and Clare spent together. He’s trying to decide if he likes her more or the voice more

Scene: At Jerry’s apartment|CLARE|Jerry…HI.
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment|JERRY|(doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o. La-la-la. (haha)
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment|GEORGE|You broke up with her? Why?
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment|JERRY|So we could do the voice. (doing the voice) La-la-la. What’s the matter?
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment|GEORGE|I think I’m getting tired of it. I mean is that all it does? Hello? La-la-la?
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment|JERRY|No, it can do anything. It can be Spanish. (doing the voice) Hola. Hello-o-o-o.
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment|GEORGE|I think I like the girl better than the voice.
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment|JERRY|Really?
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment|action|Elaine walks in – how does she keep getting up without that buzzer?!
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment|JERRY|(doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o.
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment|ELAINE|Still?
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment|GEORGE|I told you.
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment|ELAINE|Alright, here you go, choke on it (hands him money).

Scene: At Jerry’s apartment|ELAINE|Yeah, well not for long. I’m breaking up with him.
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment|JERRY|No, I don’t think so. I’ve seen you two together. You make each other miserable. It’s kismet.
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment|ELAINE|Double or nothing.
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment|JERRY|Done.
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment|GEORGE|(talking from bathroom) Witness?
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment|JERRY|You’re in there again.
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment|GEORGE|I think Play Now is putting something in my food.
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment|action|Kramer walks in
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment|ELAINE|Alright, I’m out of here.
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment|JERRY|What is this? (Kramer is wearing jeans that look like it doesn’t fit him).
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment|KRAMER|I don’t know. I found them in your closet. Ever since Darren left I haven’t been able to find anything. He took all my clothes to some cleaners. I’m clueless. (looks at clock) Is that clock right?
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment|JERRY|Yeah. Nine o’clock.
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment|KRAMER|I was supposed to pick up Newman at the zoo twelve hours ago.
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment|JERRY|(doing the voice) Good-bye Kramer.
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment|KRAMER|Jerry, buddy, I got to tell you something. That voice is played.
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment|JERRY|Really?
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment|KRAMER|So played.
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment|GEORGE|I told you.
Scene: Hallway, Darren is knocking on Kramer’s door|KRAMER|Darren? What are you doing here? The college canceled the internship.
Scene: Hallway, Darren is knocking on Kramer’s door|DARREN|I don’t care about the internship. I care about Kramerica.
Scene: Hallway, Darren is knocking on Kramer’s door|KRAMER|Kramerica is no more.
Scene: Hallway, Darren is knocking on Kramer’s door|DARREN|What about the oil tanker bladder system? We were going to put an end to maritime oil spills.
Scene: Hallway, Darren is knocking on Kramer’s door|KRAMER|Probably. Darren, you go home. Forget about Kramerica.
Scene: Hallway, Darren is knocking on Kramer’s door|action|Kramer slams door
Scene: Hallway, Darren is knocking on Kramer’s door|action|Kramer opens door
Scene: Hallway, Darren is knocking on Kramer’s door|KRAMER|Well, you’re still here?

Scene: At Play Now – in the bosses office|GEORGE|You see if I stay the whole year, I get it all.
Scene: At Play Now – in the bosses office|THOMASSOULO|Want to play hand ball huh? Fine. (calls on intercom) Attention Play Now employees, George Costanza’s handicapped bathroom is now open on the sixteenth floor to all employees and their families.
Scene: At Play Now – in the bosses office|GEORGE|Well played.
Scene: At Play Now – in the bosses office|THOMASSOULO|I’ll see you in hell Costanza.
Scene: At Jerry’s apartment|JERRY|(on the phone with Clare) Clare thanks for giving me a second chance. Our relationship is certainly worth more than some silly, stupid voice. Hold on one second. (George walks in – Jerry asks George) So we definitely don’t want to do the voice anymore? (George shakes his head NO) Alright, we’re back together again, great. Bye bye.
Scene: Hallway – Kramer & Darren are pushing an oil tank|KRAMER|Hey.
Scene: Hallway – Kramer & Darren are pushing an oil tank|JERRY|Trouble down at the plant?
Scene: Hallway – Kramer & Darren are pushing an oil tank|KRAMER|It’s a tank of oil. Darren and I are finally going to test out my bladder system.
Scene: Hallway – Kramer & Darren are pushing an oil tank|GEORGE|You have to drink that whole thing?
Scene: Hallway – Kramer & Darren are pushing an oil tank|KRAMER|No. No. No. It’s for oil tankers. All I need to do is fill some sort of rubber container with oil and then drop it to see whether or not it can restrain the impact.
Scene: Hallway – Kramer & Darren are pushing an oil tank|JERRY|I understand (not really understanding, lol).
Scene: Hallway – Kramer & Darren are pushing an oil tank|GEORGE|Would a giant rubber ball work?
