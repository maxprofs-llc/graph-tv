Setting: Jerry's apartment|JERRY|The Van Buren Boys? There's a street gang named after President Martin Van Buren?
Setting: Jerry's apartment|KRAMER|Oh yeah, and they're just as mean as he was! So, I make a move to the door, you know, (makes a noise) they block it! So, I lunged for the bathroom. (demonstrates) I grab the knob - Occupado! Then they back me up agains the cartoon map of Italy, and all of the sudden, they just stop.

Setting: Outside a coffee shop|ELLEN|Yeah, no one called.
Setting: Coffee shop|JERRY|They act like it was some act of charity. Just going out with her.
Setting: Coffee shop|GEORGE|So, she's the loser of the group. Every group has someone that they all make fun of.. Like us with Elaine. (Jerry thinks about this, then shakes it off)
Setting: Coffee shop|JERRY|There is no way Ellen is the loser of that group.
Setting: Coffee shop|GEORGE|Are you looking deep down at the real person underneath?

Setting: Coffee shop|JERRY|Is he smart?

Setting: Coffee shop|JERRY|Hey! Just like you pretend to be.
Setting: Coffee shop|GEORGE|Yes. With a little guidance, Steven Koren is going to be everything I claim to be, only for real. That's my dream, Jerry.

Setting: J. Peterman's apartment|ELAINE|Mister Peterman, thanks for having me over. Your place isn't quite what I imagined.. (It's plain, with no sign of Peterman's personality)
Setting: J. Peterman's apartment|PETERMAN|Ohhh.. It's just a place to flop. (Sits in his recliner)
Setting: J. Peterman's apartment|ELAINE|Well, (Clears throat) what part of your life (hits the record button on a mini-recorder, and sets it down on the table) do you want to start with? Foreign intrigue? Exotic romances?
Setting: J. Peterman's apartment|PETERMAN|Oh, Elaine, we've covered all of that in the catalogue ad nauseum. No, I would like this book to be about my day-to-day life.
Setting: J. Peterman's apartment|ELAINE|Oh.
Setting: J. Peterman's apartment|PETERMAN|(Turns on the T.V, and starts flipping through the channels) Oh damn. They changed the cable stations again.. just when I finally memorized them.
Setting: J. Peterman's apartment|ELAINE|Well, Mister Peterman, do you want to, um..
Setting: J. Peterman's apartment|PETERMAN|(Still flipping through the channels) 2.. CBS..
Setting: J. Peterman's apartment|ELAINE|get, um, started..
Setting: J. Peterman's apartment|PETERMAN|3.. I don't know what that is.. where's my damn preview channel?
Setting: J. Peterman's apartment|ELAINE|(After observing Peterman's home life) Well, I - I got ta tell you, Mister Peterman.. I don't think I see a whole book here.
Setting: J. Peterman's apartment|PETERMAN|well, I'm sure we'll come up with something. What do you say you and I order ourselves a pie? Do you like Lorenzo's?
Setting: J. Peterman's apartment|ELAINE|You know, a friend of mine almost got beat up at that place by the Van Buren Boys?
Setting: J. Peterman's apartment|PETERMAN|(Interested) You don't say.
Setting: J. Peterman's apartment|ELAINE|Yeah. The only think that saved him is that he accidentally flashed their secret gang sign.
Setting: J. Peterman's apartment|PETERMAN|Well, that's pretty exciting. (Pause) Let's put that in the book.
Setting: J. Peterman's apartment|ELAINE|But, that didn't happen to you.
Setting: J. Peterman's apartment|PETERMAN|So, we pay off your friend, and it becomes a Peterman.
Setting: J. Peterman's apartment|ELAINE|No, I - I really don't think you can do that.
Setting: J. Peterman's apartment|PETERMAN|(Looking at his dying plant) Ohh, damn. I forgot to buy plant food again.. I'll bet I got a coupon for it. (Starts looking through a small coupon box)
Setting: J. Peterman's apartment|ELAINE|You know what? Maybe I better talk to my friend.
Setting: Coffee shop|action|Jerry's on a date with Ellen, he's desperately trying to find out what is wrong with her
Setting: Coffee shop|JERRY|Is that the same outfit you were wearing yesterday?
Setting: Coffee shop|ELLEN|No, this is brand new. Do you like it?
Setting: Coffee shop|JERRY|Actually, yeah. (Pause) Wait a second! Is that the fork that fell on the floor?! (Dramatically) Are you using the fork that fell on the floor?!
Setting: Coffee shop|ELLEN|(Laughs) No, Jerry, the waitress game be another one.
Setting: Coffee shop|JERRY|I guess that's all right.
Setting: Coffee shop|ELLEN|Is something wrong, Jerry?
Setting: Coffee shop|JERRY|No, absolutely nothing. (They get up to leave) You're fantastic! (They meet up with Kramer and George on the way out) Hey guys!
Setting: Coffee shop|GEORGE|Hey.
Setting: Coffee shop|JERRY|(Gesturing to Ellen) Kramer, George, this is Ellen.
Setting: Coffee shop|action|Kramer gives a look
Setting: Susan Ross Foundation conference room|GEORGE|Ladies and gentlemen, this (Opens the door, Steven is standing there) is Steven Koren. His G.P.A. is a solid 2.0! Right in that meaty part of the curve - not showing off, not falling behind.
Setting: Susan Ross Foundation conference room|WYCK|George, the quailifications for this scholarship were suppose to be.. largely academic.
Setting: Susan Ross Foundation conference room|GEORGE|I'm sure we're all aware of the flaws and biases of standardized tests..
Setting: Susan Ross Foundation conference room|WYCK|These aren't standardized tests - these are his grades.
Setting: Susan Ross Foundation conference room|GEORGE|Besides, Steven Koren has the highest of aspirations. He wants to be (pauses for effect) an architect.
Setting: Susan Ross Foundation conference room|WYCK|Is that right?
Setting: Susan Ross Foundation conference room|STEVEN|Actually, maybe I could set my sights a little bit higher.
Setting: Susan Ross Foundation conference room|GEORGE|(Laughs) Steven, nothing is higher than an architect.
Setting: Susan Ross Foundation conference room|STEVEN|I think I'd really like to be a city planner. (Sits down, addressing the entire foundation board) Why limit myself to just one building, when I can design a whole city?
Setting: Susan Ross Foundation conference room|WYCK|Well, that's a good point.
Setting: Susan Ross Foundation conference room|GEORGE|(Mutters) No, it's not.
Setting: Susan Ross Foundation conference room|STEVEN|Well, isn't an architect just an art school drop-out with a tilty desk, and a big ruler? (Laughs - so do the board members)
Setting: Susan Ross Foundation conference room|GEORGE|(Irritated) It's called a T-square.
Setting: Susan Ross Foundation conference room|WYCK|You know, the stupidest guy in my fraternity became an architect - after he flunked out of dental school! (Everyone but George laughs) Contratulations, young man. (Shakes Steven's hand)
Setting: Susan Ross Foundation conference room|STEVEN|Thank you.
Setting: Susan Ross Foundation conference room|WYCK|Susan would be proud of what you're doing.
Setting: Susan Ross Foundation conference room|STEVEN|Thank you.

Setting: Jerry's apartment|JERRY|So you're denying him the scholarship just because he wants to be a city planner?
Setting: Jerry's apartment|GEORGE|I was betrayed! That kid was like a son to me. And if there's one person you should be able to hold down, it's your own flesh and blood. Like my father.. my father's father before him.

Setting: Jerry's apartment|JERRY|What?!
Setting: Jerry's apartment|KRAMER|(Adding) Jerry, she's a loser. (George points to Kramer - gesturing that he's right on target)
Setting: Jerry's apartment|JERRY|Where is this coming from? She's great!
Setting: Jerry's apartment|GEORGE|(Concerned) Why're you doing this, Jerry? Is it your career? Things will pick up.
Setting: Jerry's apartment|JERRY|There's nothing wrong with my career!
Setting: Jerry's apartment|KRAMER|(Like a parent) Well, I still like the Bloomingdale's executive training program for him.
Setting: Jerry's apartment|GEORGE|I though we said we weren't going to discuss that now!
Setting: Jerry's apartment|KRAMER|Well, you know, I think it's something he should consider.
Setting: Jerry's apartment|GEORGE|Of course he should consider it, but now is not the time!
Setting: Jerry's apartment|KRAMER|Listen, George, all these issues are interrelated.
Setting: Jerry's apartment|JERRY|(Fed up) Alright! Excuse me! (Gets up) I'm not buying any of this!

Setting: Cafe|KRAMER|Uh.. ah, (Looks over at Elaine, and realizes he can't tell the Van Buren Boys story) Oh, nothing - nothing.. No, I certainly don't have any stories, if that's what you're implying. (Laughs heartily)
Setting: Cafe|GEORGE|(Frantic) Kramer, do you know what those guys are gonna do to me?!
Setting: Cafe|KRAMER|Yeah, well, uh.. you know uh, you didn't hear from me, but, uh, the Van Buren Boys - they never hassle their own kind.

Setting: Cafe|action|Kramer nods his head while drinking from a mug of beer
Setting: Jerry's apartment|ELAINE|These Kramer stories are unusable! (Thumbs through them) I mean, some of them aren't even stories! (Holds one out) Look, this is a list of things in his apartment!

Setting: Jerry's apartment|ELAINE|How am I ever gonna turn this into a book?
Setting: Jerry's apartment|JERRY|Well, just shape them - change them. You're a writer.
Setting: Jerry's apartment|ELAINE|Yes! I'm a writer.
Setting: Jerry's apartment|JERRY|Make them interesting.
Setting: Jerry's apartment|ELAINE|Interesting! Of course! People love interesting writing!

Setting: Jerry's apartment|JERRY|Yeah. I'm flying them in to meet Ellen. I don't know where to turn! I gotta see what they think of her.

Setting: Jerry's apartment|KRAMER|Oh, hey! Hey, have I told you about my bunions? Oh, you're gonna love this story! (Rubs his hands together) So, I line up my cold cuts on the couch next to me, but as I'm stacking them up, they keep falling into my foot bath! (Jerry and Elaine look disgusted)
Setting: Jerry's apartment|JERRY|Kramer, this is awful! We don't want to hear about this!
Setting: Jerry's apartment|KRAMER|Damn!
Setting: Jerry's apartment|JERRY|What?
Setting: Jerry's apartment|KRAMER|Oh, I bought a bunch of bunion stories from Newman - but they all stink!

Setting: Peterman's office|ELAINE|Oh, what didn't you like about the first chapter?
Setting: Peterman's office|PETERMAN|Well, it started out nicely: "I'm returning some pants." A very identifiable problem.. (turns page) "I set of down a train tunnel.".. (turns page) But that's where the story takes a most unappealing turn.
Setting: Peterman's office|ELAINE|Oh, no, no! That's where it gets interesting! Don't you see? The - the train is bearing down on you, you - you dive into a side tunnel - and you run into a whole band of underground tunnel dwellers!
Setting: Peterman's office|PETERMAN|It just seems so cliched, and obvious. It's not interesting writing.
Setting: Peterman's office|ELAINE|Yeah.. yeah. I know. Um.. how about if, instead of.. diving from the train, you.. uh, you, I don't know, you slip and, and fall in some mud, and.. ruin your pants?
Setting: Peterman's office|PETERMAN|(Intrigued) The very pants I was returning. That's perfect irony! Elaine, that is interesting writing! (The intercom beeps)
Setting: Peterman's office|SECRETARY|I have a Cosmo Kramer on line 4.
Setting: Peterman's office|PETERMAN|(Picks up the phone) Peterman, here.
Setting: Peterman's office|KRAMER|Mister Peterson, you gotta sell me my stories back!
Setting: Peterman's office|PETERMAN|You want to know something? I no longer need them!
Setting: Peterman's office|ELAINE|No, no. Mister Peterman, why don't we keep them - as a, as a reference?
Setting: Peterman's office|PETERMAN|Nonsense! (To Kramer) I have Benes' woderfully imaginative mind to spin my stories. You take back your tales, you vagabond!
Setting: Peterman's office|KRAMER|Yippie-yi-yay!
Setting: Peterman's office|PETERMAN|(Hangs up) There you are, Elaine. Go forth, and create. (Elaine gets up to leave) And, by the way, when you get to that chapter about my romantic escapades - feel free to toss yourself in the mix.

Setting: NYC Alley|MORTY|How're your folks?
Setting: NYC Alley|GEORGE|Eh, they're trying to pick out a new couch - you don't want to know. (Remembering the watching Van Buren Boys) Give me your wallet, or I'll spill your guts right here on the street!
Setting: NYC Alley|MORTY|What did you say?
Setting: NYC Alley|GEORGE|Come on, hurry up, old man! I'm an animal!
Setting: NYC Alley|HELEN|You're being very rude. Come on, Morty.
Setting: NYC Alley|GEORGE|(Pleading) Please, please, they're gonna hit me! (Attempts to grab Helen's purse, she starts hitting George defensively, he backs off)
Setting: NYC Alley|MORTY|Tell your parents we said 'Hi!' (They leave)
