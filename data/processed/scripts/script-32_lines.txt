Jerry’s Apartment|JERRY|What’s so amazing? You’ve seen him before.
Jerry’s Apartment|GEORGE|I haven’t seen him for months.
Jerry’s Apartment|JERRY|What was the dream?
Jerry’s Apartment|GEORGE|I was doing standup comedy in Kennebunkport Maine. ??? night club. The stage was on a cliff and the audience was throwing all the comics off.

Jerry’s Apartment|GEORGE|I just got fired.
Jerry’s Apartment|JERRY|Alright, come on, lets get out of here.

Metropolitan Hospital Center|JERRY|That’s not too bad. It’s not like a Sunny von Bulow comma. The doctor said he should snap out of it anytime.
Metropolitan Hospital Center|GINA|You know why he did this? Because I told him it was over. I did not want to see him anymore.
Metropolitan Hospital Center|JERRY|Really? It’s over?
Metropolitan Hospital Center|GINA|I could not stand it another minute. Yesterday he turned over a man’s hot dog stand because he thought the man was looking at me. And then after he saw you in the hall. Ach, he was crazy with jealousy.
Metropolitan Hospital Center|JERRY|Oh boy, did he say anything about me?
Metropolitan Hospital Center|GINA|He does not like you. And all indications are he does not like Drake’s Coffee Cake.
Metropolitan Hospital Center|JERRY|He said that?
Metropolitan Hospital Center|GINA|He was screaming about it all night. How it’s too sweet and it falls apart when you eat it.
Metropolitan Hospital Center|JERRY|I’m sorry if I caused any trouble. I was just being friendly.
Metropolitan Hospital Center|GINA|I wasn’t.
Metropolitan Hospital Center|JERRY|You weren’t?
Metropolitan Hospital Center|GINA|No, I have thought about you many times. Have you thought about me?
Metropolitan Hospital Center|JERRY|Of course.
Metropolitan Hospital Center|GINA|Tell me everything.
Metropolitan Hospital Center|JERRY|Are you sure he can’t hear anything? . . .MARTIN, MARTIN.
Metropolitan Hospital Center|GINA|I wish he was not in a coma. I wish he was dead. I wish I could pull the plug out from him.
Metropolitan Hospital Center|JERRY|I, would, I would wait on that. I know how you feel but. Juries today, you never know how they’re going to look at a thing like this.
Metropolitan Hospital Center|GINA|I saw you looking at your watch. You want to leave? Go ahead.
Metropolitan Hospital Center|JERRY|No, I just wanted to see what time it was.
Metropolitan Hospital Center|GINA|Are you afraid of him?
Metropolitan Hospital Center|JERRY|No.
Metropolitan Hospital Center|GINA|Then kiss me.
Metropolitan Hospital Center|JERRY|Here?
Metropolitan Hospital Center|GINA|Yes, right here.
Metropolitan Hospital Center|JERRY|Is this the proper venue?
Metropolitan Hospital Center|GINA|You don’t want to?
Metropolitan Hospital Center|JERRY|No, no, I want to. I, I very much want to. I, I desire to. I, I pine to.
Metropolitan Hospital Center|GINA|Then kiss me right in front of him.
Metropolitan Hospital Center|JERRY|I can’t. What if he wakes up?
Metropolitan Hospital Center|GINA|A man is lying here unconscious and you’re afraid of him? What kind of a man are you?
Metropolitan Hospital Center|JERRY|A man who respects a good comma. If it was one of those in and out comas, maybe. But when a guy’s got a coma going like this … you don’t want to mess with it.
Jerry’s apartment|KRAMER|Hey.
Jerry’s apartment|JERRY|Hey.
Jerry’s apartment|KRAMER|Did you hear about Martin?
Jerry’s apartment|JERRY|Yeah, I heard.
Jerry’s apartment|KRAMER|I can’t believe he’s in a coma.
Jerry’s apartment|KRAMER|He’s got my vacuum cleaner. You know I loaned it to him. He never returned it. The carpets are filthy. What am I going to do?
Jerry’s apartment|JERRY|Who told you about Martin?
Jerry’s apartment|KRAMER|Newman! He’s good friends with him.
Jerry’s apartment|JERR|Oh, big mouth Newman. I should have guessed.
Jerry’s apartment|KRAMER|He’s got all of my attachments, you know.
Jerry’s apartment|JERRY|Hey, let me ask you something. How long do you have to wait for a guy to come out of a coma before you can ask his ex-girlfriend out?
Jerry’s apartment|KRAMER|What, Gina? Why wait? Why not just call Doctor Kavorkian?
Jerry’s apartment|JERRY|You know I don’t get that whole suicide machine. There’s no tall buildings where these people live? They can’t wrap their lips around a revolver like a normal person?
Jerry’s apartment|KRAMER|So what’s going on between you and Gina?
Jerry’s apartment|JERRY|Well, I went with her to the hospital last night.
Jerry’s apartment|KRAMER|Uh, uh.
Jerry’s apartment|JERRY|So we’re in the room and she’s trying to get me to kiss her right in front of him.
Jerry’s apartment|KRAMER|Uh, uh, you see that’s the great thing about Mediterranean women. All right, so what did you do?
Jerry’s apartment|JERRY|Nothing.
Jerry’s apartment|KRAMER|Ah, what kind of a man are you? The guy is unconscious in a coma and you don’t have the guts to kiss his girlfriend?
Jerry’s apartment|JERRY|I didn’t know what the coma etiquette was.
Jerry’s apartment|KRAMER|There is no coma etiquette. You see that’s the beauty of the coma, man. It doesn’t matter what you do around it.
Jerry’s apartment|JERRY|So you’re saying, his girl, his car, his clothes, it’s all up for grabs. You can just loot the coma victim.
Jerry’s apartment|KRAMER|I’d give him 24 hours to get out of it. They can’t get out of it in 24 hours, it’s a land rush.
Jerry’s apartment|JERRY|So if the coma victim wakes up in a month, he’s thrilled, he got out of the coma. He goes home, there’s nothing left?
Jerry’s apartment|KRAMER|NOTHING LEFT! That’s why I’m trying to get that vacuum cleaner. Because somebody’s going to grab it.
The psychic’s apartment|RULA|Martin’s spirit came to you as a warning.
The psychic’s apartment|ELAINE|Why would he come to George?

The psychic’s apartment|RULA|Who’s Pauline?

The psychic’s apartment|RULA|Do you think about her?
The psychic’s apartment|GEORGE|When I hear her name mentioned.
The psychic’s apartment|RULA|Cut these with your left hand.
The psychic’s apartment|GEORGE|There was a woman, Audrey. She had a very big nose.
The psychic’s apartment|RULA|I see an Audrey, but with a small nose.
The psychic’s apartment|GEORGE|Yes, yes, she had a nose job. I loved her very deeply. Will she ever speak to me again?
The psychic’s apartment|RULA|Not in this life.
The psychic’s apartment|ELAINE|Should you be smoking?
The psychic’s apartment|RULA|Does it bother you?
The psychic’s apartment|ELAINE|You’re pregnant.
The psychic’s apartment|GEORGE|Elaine.
The psychic’s apartment|RULA|I smoked when I had Faisy.
The psychic’s apartment|RULA|Ah oh.
The psychic’s apartment|GEORGE|Ah oh? What? What Ah oh?

The psychic’s apartment|GEORGE|You can see the Cayman Islands in there? Is something going to happen to me? What?
The psychic’s apartment|ELAINE|It’s really bad for the fetus. Do you know that.
The psychic’s apartment|GEORGE|Elaine, she’s a psychic. She knows how the kid’s going to be.
The psychic’s apartment|GEORGE|Should I not go on this trip?
The psychic’s apartment|RULA|George, I am going to tell you something and I want you to really hear me.
The psychic’s apartment|ELAINE|Now listen. I just don’t know how a person, with everything we now know about pre-natal care can put a cigarette in her mouth.
The psychic’s apartment|GEORGE|Elaine, what are you doing?
The psychic’s apartment|ELAINE|It’s disgusting.
The psychic’s apartment|RULA|I DON’T BELIVE IT. I would like you both to leave.
The psychic’s apartment|ELAINE|Oh fine, I don’t like to be around people who are just so irresponsible.
The psychic’s apartment|RULA|Get the hell out.

The psychic’s apartment|RULA|Get out.
The psychic’s apartment|GEORGE|Not a plane crash. (leaving) Is it a plane crash?
Jerry’s apartment|GINA|I do not like your toothbrush. There are no bristles.
Jerry’s apartment|JERRY|You can say what you want about me but I’ll be damned if I’m going to stand here while you insult my toothbrush.
Jerry’s apartment|GINA|It is too small for someone with such a big mouth (kisses Kerry). Let me ask you. What will you do if Martine wakes up? Run away like a mouse?
Jerry’s apartment|JERRY|No, more like the Three Stooges at the end of every movie.
Jerry’s apartment|GINA|Who are these Stooges you speak of?
Jerry’s apartment|JERRY|They’re a comedy team.
Jerry’s apartment|GINA|Tell me about them. Everything.
Jerry’s apartment|JERRY|Well, they’re three kind of funny looking guys and they hit each other a lot.
Jerry’s apartment|GINA|You will show me The Stooges?
Jerry’s apartment|JERRY|I will show you The Stooges.
Jerry’s apartment|GINA|When?
Jerry’s apartment|JERRY|Well, I don’t really know where The Stooges are right now but if I locate them you will be the first to know.
Jerry’s apartment|GINA|Come, you walk me to a cab.
Jerry’s apartment|JERRY|Well, uh, I uh, I don’t want you to get upset or anything but uh, with Martin and all, well maybe it’s not such a good idea for us to be seen together in the building, because, you know, he had a lot of friends here.
Jerry’s apartment|GINA|You’re still afraid. You are not a man.
Jerry’s apartment|JERRY|Well then what are all those ties and sport jackets doing in my closet?
Jerry’s apartment|GINA|Are you going to walk me to a cab or not?
