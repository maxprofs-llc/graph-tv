|JERRY|Have you ever called someone up, and you're disappointed when they answer the phone?  You wanted the machine.  You know, and you're always kind of thrown off, (left hand up to side of face, pretending its a receiver) you go "Oh, I eh, I - I didn't know you were there, I ah - just wanted to leave a message saying, sorry I missed you."
|action|Jerry and Naomi enter Jerry's apartment
|JERRY|Well this is it.
|NAOMI|Oh, this is nice. Thanks again for the Chinese food.
|JERRY|Oh, you're welcome. You know I think I ate too much of that garlic.
|NAOMI|Yeah, me too.
|JERRY|No, I ate the whole plate. I didn't know those little things were garlic. I thought they were peanuts.
|NAOMI|(laughs) - Nnnhhahahahahahahahahahahahahaha (obnoxious laugh). Oh, you know what? I think Naked Gun is on. Oh I've seen it. I laughed through that whole thing. You wanna watch?
|JERRY|No, I mean, I don't think so.
|NAOMI|I thought you liked to laugh. I thought you were happy go lucky.

|NAOMI|Ahahahahahahahahaha.
|JERRY|That's not funny Naomi.
|NAOMI|Ah hahahaha. (points at Jerry)
|JERRY|I didn't mean to be funny there. Why don't you check the TV guide. I think uh, Holocaust is on.
|action|Jerry goes over to the answering machine and plays the message, then walks back over to the kitchen to get a drink from his bottled water.  Naomi sits on the couch looking through the TV Guide, also listening to George's message

Not only that, a juicer is one of the healthiest ways ... (Naomi exits) it makes the juice ... it extracts the-the pulp and-and-and the vitamins, for-for long life and-and-and vitality.
in Jerry's apartment|JERRY|How could you leave a message like that on my machine.?
in Jerry's apartment|GEORGE|Well how could you just play your message in front of anybody?
