George and Jerry at Jerry's apartment.|GEORGE|So?
George and Jerry at Jerry's apartment.|JERRY|So. I figure since she likes one hairless animal why not another.
George and Jerry at Jerry's apartment.|GEORGE|Oh really. You tell her you shaved it?

Gerge and Mary Anne at Monks|GEORGE|Well what if I told you I'm thinking of moving here?
Gerge and Mary Anne at Monks|JERRY|You're moving to New York? That's fantastic. I can see you all the time now.
Gerge and Mary Anne at Monks|GEORGE|Eat me alive, huh? We'll see who can make it in *this* town.
Gerge and Mary Anne at Monks|JERRY|What is it she think you can't do?
Gerge and Mary Anne at Monks|GEORGE|Find a job. Get an apartment.
Gerge and Mary Anne at Monks|JERRY|How did you do those things?
Gerge and Mary Anne at Monks|GEORGE|Never mind. The're done. All I have to do now is redo them. You know if you take everything I've ever done in my entire life and condense it down into one day, it looks decent.
Gerge and Mary Anne at Monks|JERRY|Hey, what were you doing with that bus yesterday?
Gerge and Mary Anne at Monks|KRAMER|Here you go, here you go, check it out.
Gerge and Mary Anne at Monks|JERRY|"The Real Peterman Reality Bus Tour". I'm confused.
Gerge and Mary Anne at Monks|KRAMER|Peterman's book is big business. People want to know the stories behind the stories.
Gerge and Mary Anne at Monks|JERRY|Nobody wants to go on a three hour bus tour of a totally unknown person's life.
Gerge and Mary Anne at Monks|KRAMER|I'm only charging $37.50, plus you get a pizza bagel and desert.

Gerge and Mary Anne at Monks|GEORGE|He eats those?
Gerge and Mary Anne at Monks|KRAMER|No. I eat those. I'm the real Peterman.
Gerge and Mary Anne at Monks|GEORGE|I think I understand this. Jay Peterman is real. His biography is not. Now, you Kramer are real.
Gerge and Mary Anne at Monks|KRAMER|Talk to me.
Gerge and Mary Anne at Monks|GEORGE|But your life is Peterman's. Now the bus tour, which is real, takes to places that, while they are real, they are not real in sense that they did not *really* happen to the *real* Peterman which is you.
Gerge and Mary Anne at Monks|KRAMER|Understand?
Gerge and Mary Anne at Monks|JERRY|Yeah. $37.50 for a Three Musketeers.
Elaine and Mr. Lippman at Monk's|ELAINE|So? What do you want me to do about it?

Elaine and Mr. Lippman at Monk's|ELAINE|Deal. Here's your problem. You're making just the muffin tops. You've gotta make the *whole* muffin. Then you... Pop the top, toss the stump. Taste.
Elaine and Mr. Lippman at Monk's|ELAINE|Yeah.
Elaine and Mr. Lippman at Monk's|ELAINE|I don't know, give em to a soup kitchen.
Elaine and Mr. Lippman at Monk's|ELAINE|And one more thing, you really think we need the exclamation point? Because, it's not "Top of the Muffin *TO YOU!!!*"
At Jerry's apartment|KRAMER|Hey Jerry. What is this? Lady Gillette? What's going on?

Elaine at the muffin shop|REBECCA|Oh, so you just assume that the homeless will eat them, they'll eat anything?
Elaine at the muffin shop|REBECCA|I know what you thought. They don't have homes, they don't have jobs, what do they need the top of a muffin for? They're lucky to get the stumps.
Elaine at the muffin shop|ELAINE|If the homeless don't like them the homeless don't have to eat them.
