Silvio, running up and knocking on Kramer's door.|KRAMER|Yeah, sure, he's a celebrity. Oh, yeah, they wear a lot of furs. They're desperate, insecure people.
Silvio, running up and knocking on Kramer's door.|SILVIO|Yes, you are right. It's all about, me, me, me. Please, look at me! I am so pretty! Love me! Want me!
Silvio, running up and knocking on Kramer's door.|KRAMER|Yeah, something like that.
Jerry in his apartment with Kramer.|JERRY|I have to do what?
Jerry in his apartment with Kramer.|KRAMER|All you have to do is wear the fur so Silvio thinks it's yours.
Jerry in his apartment with Kramer.|JERRY|I'm not wearing the fur.
Jerry in his apartment with Kramer.|KRAMER|Well, then, Newman and I, we get thrown out of the building.
Jerry in his apartment with Kramer.|JERRY|Is that right?
Jerry in his apartment with Kramer.|KRAMER|All right, why don't you just take a good, hard look at what your life will be like if I'm not around?
Jerry in his apartment with Kramer.|JERRY|Newman, too?
Jerry in his apartment with Kramer.|KRAMER|Oh, come on, man! Well, I'll tell you what, if you do this, I'll give you that walkman you're always asking about.
Jerry in his apartment with Kramer.|JERRY|That's my walkman!
Jerry in his apartment with Kramer.|KRAMER|And you'll get it back.

Jerry in his apartment with Kramer.|GEORGE|Hey.
Jerry in his apartment with Kramer.|KRAMER|Oh, hey, and by the way, uh, that walkman was broke when you gave it to me.
Jerry in his apartment with Kramer.|JERRY|George, did you get that chair yet?
Jerry in his apartment with Kramer.|GEORGE|It gets here when it gets here. Would you stop ridin' me?
Jerry in his apartment with Kramer.|JERRY|You know what? Just call up and cancel it. I'm out.
Jerry in his apartment with Kramer.|GEORGE|Excuse me?
Jerry in his apartment with Kramer.|JERRY|Joe Mayo doesn't like my taste in music. He's not gettin' a gift from me.
Jerry in his apartment with Kramer.|GEORGE|Oh, I can't believe you're dropping out, too. So now Kramer and I have to pay for the entire gift?
Jerry in his apartment with Kramer.|KRAMER|Whoa, whoa. Now, who's this Joe Mayo everyone's talking about?
Jerry in his apartment with Kramer.|GEORGE|He's the guy we're the buying the chair for, remember? It was your suggestion.
Jerry in his apartment with Kramer.|KRAMER|I think the chair is a fantastic gift idea. But I never heard of this Joe Mayo. And frankly, it sounds made up.
Jerry in his apartment with Kramer.|GEORGE|Oh, so now I have to buy this whole chair by myself?
Jerry in his apartment with Kramer.|JERRY|No, you don't have to buy anything.
Jerry in his apartment with Kramer.|GEORGE|I already bought it! I've been lyin' to you for three days, and now you're all screwin' me!
Jerry in his apartment with Kramer.|JERRY|I don't understand. Why didn't you tell us you had it?
Jerry in his apartment with Kramer.|GEORGE|I needed it! My back is... a little tweaked.
Jerry in his apartment with Kramer.|JERRY|Because of your giant wallet. Just get rid of it!
Jerry in his apartment with Kramer.|GEORGE|Never! It is a part of me. I will just return the chair, and it will be easy, because the receipt is in my good friend.
Jerry in his apartment with Kramer.|JERRY|Your good friend is morbidly obese.
Jerry in his apartment with Kramer.|GEORGE|Well, at least, I'm not carrying a purse.
Jerry in his apartment with Kramer.|JERRY|It's not a purse. It's European!
Jerry in his apartment with Kramer.|KRAMER|All right, Silvio's down there. He's shoveling the walk. Now, all you gotta do is put this on, you go down to the corner, you pick up a paper, and you come right back.
