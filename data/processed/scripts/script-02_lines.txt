COMEDY CLUB – NIGHT|action|Jerry is on stage, performing.
COMEDY CLUB – NIGHT|JERRY|So, I’m on line at the supermarket. Two women in front of me. One of them, her total was eight dollars, the other three dollars. They both of course choose to pay by the use of the...
COMEDY CLUB – NIGHT|action|He pauses and gestures to audience for response.
COMEDY CLUB – NIGHT|AUDIENCE|Cheque.
COMEDY CLUB – NIGHT|JERRY|Cheque. Now, the fact is, if it’s a woman in front of you that’s writing the cheque, you will not be waiting long. I have noticed that women are very fast with cheques, y’know, ‘cause they write out so many cheques. The keys, they can never find in their purse, they don’t know where that is, but the cheque book: they got that. They never fumble for the cheque book. The cheque book comes out of a holster: (Jerry “draws” imaginary book from a holster.) “Who do I make it out to? There’s my ID.” There’s something about a cheque that, to a man, is not masculine. I don’t know exactly what it is. I think to a man, a cheque is like a note from your mother that says, “I don’t have any money, but if you’ll contact these people, I’m sure they’ll stick up for me... If you just trust me this one time- I don’t have any money but I have these. I wrote on these. Is this of any value at all?”
VIDEO STORE – NIGHT|action|Jerry and Elaine are picking out a movie for the night.
VIDEO STORE – NIGHT|JERRY|What’s that one?
VIDEO STORE – NIGHT|ELAINE|“Coccoon II: The Return”. I guess they didn’t like it up there.
VIDEO STORE – NIGHT|JERRY|Maybe they came back for Chinese food. Y’know Maureen Stapleton, if she gets a craving, she’s probably screamin’ at those aliens, “I gotta have a lo mein!”
VIDEO STORE – NIGHT|ELAINE|Okay, what’re we doing here? I have seen everything.
VIDEO STORE – NIGHT|JERRY|Oh yeah? I don’t believe you’ve seen... this.
VIDEO STORE – NIGHT|action|Jerry shows Elaine a movie from the Adult section.
VIDEO STORE – NIGHT|ELAINE|Oh, lovely.
VIDEO STORE – NIGHT|JERRY|Yeah.
VIDEO STORE – NIGHT|ELAINE|What do you think their parents think?
VIDEO STORE – NIGHT|JERRY|“So, uh, what’s your son doing now, Dr. Stevens?” “Oh, he’s a public fornicator. Yes, he’s a fine boy...”
VIDEO STORE – NIGHT|ELAINE|Y’know what? This would be a really funny gift for Pamela’s birthday.
VIDEO STORE – NIGHT|JERRY|Pamela? Do I know her?
VIDEO STORE – NIGHT|ELAINE|Yeah, you met her when we were going out.
VIDEO STORE – NIGHT|JERRY|Oh yeah, right...
VIDEO STORE – NIGHT|ELAINE|You have no idea who I’m talking about, do you?
VIDEO STORE – NIGHT|JERRY|(quickly) No.
VIDEO STORE – NIGHT|ELAINE|Blonde hair, remember? Glasses? (pause) Have you totally blocked out the entire time we were a couple?
VIDEO STORE – NIGHT|JERRY|(a lightbulb goes on in his head) Riverside Drive.
VIDEO STORE – NIGHT|ELAINE|Right! In fact... No, never mind...
VIDEO STORE – NIGHT|JERRY|Well, what is it?
VIDEO STORE – NIGHT|ELAINE|Well, a bunch of people are getting together tomorrow night at some bar for her birthday, but... (Jerry turns in disgust) you don’t want to go to... that... no.
VIDEO STORE – NIGHT|JERRY|Wait a second, wait a second. We could work out a little deal here.
VIDEO STORE – NIGHT|ELAINE|What little deal?
VIDEO STORE – NIGHT|JERRY|I will go to that, if you go with me to a little family wedding I have on Saturday.
VIDEO STORE – NIGHT|ELAINE|A wedding? Have you lost it, man?
VIDEO STORE – NIGHT|JERRY|Y’know, my parents are coming in for this...
VIDEO STORE – NIGHT|ELAINE|They’re coming in?
VIDEO STORE – NIGHT|JERRY|Yeah, tomorrow.
VIDEO STORE – NIGHT|ELAINE|Hey, did your father ever get that hair weave?
VIDEO STORE – NIGHT|JERRY|No, no. Still doin’ the big sweep across.
VIDEO STORE – NIGHT|ELAINE|Why does he do that?
VIDEO STORE – NIGHT|JERRY|Doesn’t think anyone can tell. So c’mon, do we have a deal?
VIDEO STORE – NIGHT|ELAINE|A wedding?
VIDEO STORE – NIGHT|JERRY|There’s a lot of people to mock...
VIDEO STORE – NIGHT|ELAINE|All right, what the hell.
VIDEO STORE – NIGHT|JERRY|Great!
VIDEO STORE – NIGHT|WOMAN|When you’re dead, you’re dead. That’s it. You’re not goin’ anywhere...
BAR – NIGHT|action|Elaine and Jerry enter.

BAR – NIGHT|JERRY|Was I supposed to bring something?
BAR – NIGHT|ELAINE|You could have.
BAR – NIGHT|JERRY|I met her one time...
BAR – NIGHT|ELAINE|It is not necessary.
BAR – NIGHT|JERRY|What did you say then?

BAR – NIGHT|action|Jerry and Elaine sit next to each other at a table. Across from Jerry is a strikingly beautiful woman, Vanessa. The piano is playing awful dinner music.
BAR – NIGHT|VANESSA|How big a tip do you think it’d take to get him to stop?
BAR – NIGHT|JERRY|I’m in for five...
BAR – NIGHT|VANESSA|I’ll supply the hat.
BAR – NIGHT|JERRY|(thinking) Uh-oh... What do we have here?
BAR – NIGHT|VANESSA|Why don’t you relax and take your jacket off?
BAR – NIGHT|JERRY|Oh, I can’t. Uh, I have a tendency to get chilly.
BAR – NIGHT|VANESSA|How masculine.
BAR – NIGHT|JERRY|Plus I’m wearing short sleeves, I don’t want to expose my tattoos. (Vanessa smiles; thinking) She’s unbelievable!
BAR – NIGHT|action|The guy beside Vanessa interrupts.
BAR – NIGHT|ROGER|(to Vanessa) Hey, this guy says he knows Bricker.
BAR – NIGHT|VANESSA|Oh, you know Bricker! From where?
BAR – NIGHT|JERRY|(thinking) What’s going on here? Gotta be her boyfriend, she’s too good to be alone. What’s the difference, I can’t maneouver anyway with Elaine next to me.
BAR – NIGHT|VANESSA|(to Jerry) How do you know Pamela?
BAR – NIGHT|JERRY|Uh, friend of a friend. And you?
BAR – NIGHT|VANESSA|We went to law school together.
BAR – NIGHT|ELAINE|(interrupting Jerry's conversation) Oh, Jerry!
BAR – NIGHT|JERRY|(turning to Elaine; thinking) Oh no, not now.
BAR – NIGHT|ELAINE|I had this dream last night and you were in it.
BAR – NIGHT|JERRY|Oh really? (tries turning away in the hopes Elaine gets the hint; thinking) Oh God, I gotta get out of this.
BAR – NIGHT|ELAINE|You were you, but, you weren’t you...
BAR – NIGHT|JERRY|No kidding. (thinking) Why is this happening? Please, make her stop!
BAR – NIGHT|ELAINE|I think, I think we were in my house where I grew up, and you were standing there, you were looking out the window...
BAR – NIGHT|JERRY|(thinking) This is brutal.
BAR – NIGHT|ELAINE|You turned around and you had these wooden teeth.
BAR – NIGHT|JERRY|How do you like that? (tries to turn away again; thinking)Can I turn now? Is this over? No, I can’t, I can’t. I’m stuck.
BAR – NIGHT|ELAINE|(noticing Jerry not wanting to listen; annoyed) Jerry? Are you listening to me?
BAR – NIGHT|JERRY|Yes, I heard you.
BAR – NIGHT|PAMELA|Elaine, what’s the name of that jewelry store you took me to that time?
BAR – NIGHT|JERRY|(thinking) Thank you, Pamela! (turns to talk to Vanessa; to Vanessa) So, you’re a lawyer...
BAR – NIGHT|VANESSA|Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft.
BAR – NIGHT|JERRY|(thinking) Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft. Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft... (to Vanessa) Of course, they handled my tattoo removal lawsuit.
BAR – NIGHT|VANESSA|Oh, that was you?
BAR – NIGHT|JERRY|Imagine, spelling “Mom” with two O’s.
BAR – NIGHT|VANESSA|Very funny! What do you do?
BAR – NIGHT|JERRY|Comedian.
BAR – NIGHT|VANESSA|Really? That explains it.
BAR – NIGHT|JERRY|(thinking; quickly) Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft. Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft.
BAR – NIGHT|ROGER|Are you ready?
BAR – NIGHT|VANESSA|We gotta run. Happy birthday!
BAR – NIGHT|action|Vanessa and Roger get up an leave. Jerry panics.
BAR – NIGHT|JERRY|(thinking) I can’t believe it. I got nothing! I don’t even know her name! Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft. Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppen... Sagman... Sag...
BAR – NIGHT|action|A grim stare from Elaine knocks his concentration.
TAXICAB – NIGHT|action|On the ride home from the party. Jerry and Elaine sit in the back seat.
TAXICAB – NIGHT|JERRY|That wasn’t so bad, really.
TAXICAB – NIGHT|ELAINE|Y’know, um, you could use a little work on your manners.
TAXICAB – NIGHT|JERRY|Why? What did I do?
TAXICAB – NIGHT|ELAINE|Wel-Well, I just don’t appreciate these little courtesy responses, like I’m selling you aluminum siding.
TAXICAB – NIGHT|JERRY|I was listening!
TAXICAB – NIGHT|ELAINE|No! You couldn’t wait to get back to your little... “conversation”.
TAXICAB – NIGHT|JERRY|No, you were talking about the, the um, the dream you had.
TAXICAB – NIGHT|ELAINE|Uh-huh...
TAXICAB – NIGHT|JERRY|Where you had, uh, wooden teeth.
TAXICAB – NIGHT|ELAINE|No! No! You had wooden teeth! You had wooden teeth! I didn’t have wooden teeth, you did!
TAXICAB – NIGHT|JERRY|All right, so I had wooden teeth, so what?
TAXICAB – NIGHT|ELAINE|So nothing! Nothing. (annoyed sigh)
COMEDY CLUB – NIGHT|action|Jerry is on stage, performing.
COMEDY CLUB – NIGHT|JERRY|Apparently Plato, who came up with the concept of the platonic relationship, was pretty excited about it. He named it after himself. He said, “Yeah, I got this new thing: Platonic. My idea, my name, callin’ it after myself. What I do is, I go out with the girls, I talk with them- don’t do anything, and go right home. What’d you think? I think it’s going to be big!” I bet you there were other guys in history that tried to get relationships named after them, but it didn’t work. Y’know, I bet you there were guys who tried to do it, just went, “Uh, Hi, uh my name’s Rico. Would you like to go to bed immediately? Hey, it’s a Riconic relationship.”
JERRY’S APARTMENT – NIGHT|action|Jerry’s parents, Helen and Morty, are sitting on a pullout couch. Jerry enters.
JERRY’S APARTMENT – NIGHT|JERRY|Hey!
JERRY’S APARTMENT – NIGHT|MORTY|Ah, there he is!
JERRY’S APARTMENT – NIGHT|JERRY|This is what I like, see? You come home and your parents are in your bed!
JERRY’S APARTMENT – NIGHT|HELEN|Y’know, Jerry, we don’t have to do this.
JERRY’S APARTMENT – NIGHT|JERRY|What are you talkin’ about? It’s fine, I love having you here.
JERRY’S APARTMENT – NIGHT|HELEN|Tomorrow we’ll go to a hotel.
JERRY’S APARTMENT – NIGHT|JERRY|Ma, will you stop?
JERRY’S APARTMENT – NIGHT|HELEN|No, why should we take over your apartment?
JERRY’S APARTMENT – NIGHT|JERRY|I don’t care. I’m sleeping next door.
JERRY’S APARTMENT – NIGHT|HELEN|Your friend Kramer doesn’t mind?
JERRY’S APARTMENT – NIGHT|JERRY|No, he’s making a bouillabaisse.
JERRY’S APARTMENT – NIGHT|JERRY|So, dad, lemme ask you a question. How many people work at these big law offices?
JERRY’S APARTMENT – NIGHT|MORTY|Depends on the firm.
JERRY’S APARTMENT – NIGHT|JERRY|Yeah, but if you called up and described someone, do you think they would know who it was?
JERRY’S APARTMENT – NIGHT|MORTY|What’s the matter? You need a lawyer?
JERRY’S APARTMENT – NIGHT|JERRY|No, I met someone at this party, and I know where she works, but I don’t know her name.
JERRY’S APARTMENT – NIGHT|MORTY|So why don’t you ask someone who was at the party?
JERRY’S APARTMENT – NIGHT|JERRY|Nah, the only one I could ask is Elaine, and I can’t ask her.
JERRY’S APARTMENT – NIGHT|HELEN|Why not?
JERRY’S APARTMENT – NIGHT|JERRY|Because it’s complicated. There’s some tension there.
JERRY’S APARTMENT – NIGHT|HELEN|He used to go with her.
JERRY’S APARTMENT – NIGHT|HELEN|Which one is she?
JERRY’S APARTMENT – NIGHT|MORTY|From Maryland. The one who brought you the chocolate covered cherries you didn’t like.
JERRY’S APARTMENT – NIGHT|HELEN|Oh yeah, very alert. Warm person.
JERRY’S APARTMENT – NIGHT|JERRY|Oh yeah, she’s great.
JERRY’S APARTMENT – NIGHT|HELEN|So, how come nothing materialized there?
JERRY’S APARTMENT – NIGHT|JERRY|Well, it’s a tough thing to talk about uh. I dunno...
JERRY’S APARTMENT – NIGHT|HELEN|I know what it was.
JERRY’S APARTMENT – NIGHT|JERRY|You don’t know what it was.
JERRY’S APARTMENT – NIGHT|HELEN|So, what was it?
JERRY’S APARTMENT – NIGHT|JERRY|Well, we fight a lot for some reason.
JERRY’S APARTMENT – NIGHT|JERRY|And there was a little problem with the physical chemistry.
JERRY’S APARTMENT – NIGHT|action|His parents don’t know how to respond.
JERRY’S APARTMENT – NIGHT|HELEN|Well, I think she’s a very attractive girl.
JERRY’S APARTMENT – NIGHT|JERRY|Oh, she is, she absolutely is.
JERRY’S APARTMENT – NIGHT|HELEN|I can see if there was a weight problem...
JERRY’S APARTMENT – NIGHT|JERRY|No, it’s not that. It wasn’t all one-sided.
JERRY’S APARTMENT – NIGHT|HELEN|You know, you can’t be so particular. Nobody’s perfect.
JERRY’S APARTMENT – NIGHT|JERRY|I know, I know...
JERRY’S APARTMENT – NIGHT|MORTY|Y’know Jerry, it’s a good thing I wasn’t so particular.
JERRY’S APARTMENT – NIGHT|HELEN|(hits Morty) Idiot. (to Jerry) So who’re you looking for, Sophia Loren?
JERRY’S APARTMENT – NIGHT|JERRY|That’s got nothin’ to do with it.
JERRY’S APARTMENT – NIGHT|MORTY|How about Loni Anderson?
JERRY’S APARTMENT – NIGHT|HELEN|Where do you get Loni Anderson?
JERRY’S APARTMENT – NIGHT|MORTY|Why, what’s wrong with Loni Anderson?
JERRY’S APARTMENT – NIGHT|HELEN|I like Elaine more than Loni Anderson.
JERRY’S APARTMENT – NIGHT|JERRY|What are you two talking about? Look, Elaine just wasn’t the one.
JERRY’S APARTMENT – NIGHT|HELEN|And this other one’s the one?
JERRY’S APARTMENT – NIGHT|JERRY|I dunno, maybe...
JERRY’S APARTMENT – NIGHT|MORTY|So ask Elaine there for her number.
JERRY’S APARTMENT – NIGHT|JERRY|I can’t. She’ll get upset. I never talk about other women with her, especially this one tonight.
JERRY’S APARTMENT – NIGHT|HELEN|How could you still see her if your not interested?
JERRY’S APARTMENT – NIGHT|JERRY|We’re friends.
JERRY’S APARTMENT – NIGHT|MORTY|Doesn’t sound like you’re friends to me. If you were friends you'd-you’d ask her for the number. Do you know where this other one works?
JERRY’S APARTMENT – NIGHT|JERRY|Oh yeah.
JERRY’S APARTMENT – NIGHT|MORTY|Well, go up to the office.
JERRY’S APARTMENT – NIGHT|HELEN|Up to her office?
JERRY’S APARTMENT – NIGHT|MORTY|Go to the building. She goes out to lunch, doesn’t she?
JERRY’S APARTMENT – NIGHT|JERRY|I guess.
JERRY’S APARTMENT – NIGHT|MORTY|So, you stand in the lobby, by the elevator, and wait for her to come down for lunch.
JERRY’S APARTMENT – NIGHT|JERRY|You mean stakeout the lobby?
JERRY’S APARTMENT – NIGHT|HELEN|Morty, that’s ridiculous. Just ask Elaine for the number!
JERRY’S APARTMENT – NIGHT|MORTY|He doesn’t want to ask Elaine for the number.
JERRY’S APARTMENT – NIGHT|HELEN|So you’ve got him standing by the elevator like a dope! What happens when he sees her?
JERRY’S APARTMENT – NIGHT|MORTY|He pretends he bumped into her!
JERRY’S APARTMENT – NIGHT|JERRY|Y’know what? This is not that bad an idea.

JERRY’S APARTMENT-NEXT DAY|CAROL|Jerry, we’ll see you there. Bye, Elaine.
JERRY’S APARTMENT-NEXT DAY|ELAINE|Oh, bye. Good to see you.
JERRY’S APARTMENT-NEXT DAY|ARTIE|Oh, we didn’t meet.
JERRY’S APARTMENT-NEXT DAY|JERRY|Oh, I’m sorry. Elaine, this is my cousin, Artie Levine.
JERRY’S APARTMENT-NEXT DAY|action|Jerry pronounces the name ‘le-VEEN’.
JERRY’S APARTMENT-NEXT DAY|ARTIE|(correcting Jerry) Levine.
JERRY’S APARTMENT-NEXT DAY|action|Artie pronounces it with a long “I”. Artie exits.
JERRY’S APARTMENT-NEXT DAY|JERRY|(sarcastically) Yeah, “Levine”. And I’m Jerry Cougar Mellencamp. Anyway, I admit it was a fairly ridiculous thing to do, but I mean, I mean, obviously we have a little problem here.
JERRY’S APARTMENT-NEXT DAY|ELAINE|Yeah, obviously.
JERRY’S APARTMENT-NEXT DAY|JERRY|I mean, if we’re gonna be friends, we gotta be able to talk about other people.
JERRY’S APARTMENT-NEXT DAY|ELAINE|Couldn’t agree more.
JERRY’S APARTMENT-NEXT DAY|JERRY|Good.
JERRY’S APARTMENT-NEXT DAY|ELAINE|Good.
JERRY’S APARTMENT-NEXT DAY|JERRY|Good.
JERRY’S APARTMENT-NEXT DAY|ELAINE|Great!
JERRY’S APARTMENT-NEXT DAY|JERRY|Great? Where do you get ‘great’?
JERRY’S APARTMENT-NEXT DAY|ELAINE|It’s great to... talk about... other people...
JERRY’S APARTMENT-NEXT DAY|JERRY|...Guys?
JERRY’S APARTMENT-NEXT DAY|ELAINE|Yeah.
JERRY’S APARTMENT-NEXT DAY|JERRY|Uh-huh. Yeah. So, anybody specific?
JERRY’S APARTMENT-NEXT DAY|ELAINE|No. A general guy.
JERRY’S APARTMENT-NEXT DAY|JERRY|Oh really? Elaine Marie Benes...
JERRY’S APARTMENT-NEXT DAY|ELAINE|What? No, it’s not a big deal.
JERRY’S APARTMENT-NEXT DAY|JERRY|No, that’s great! That’s terrific!
JERRY’S APARTMENT-NEXT DAY|ELAINE|No, we just met...
JERRY’S APARTMENT-NEXT DAY|JERRY|Doesn’t matter. What’s the young man’s name? I would like to meet him.
JERRY’S APARTMENT-NEXT DAY|ELAINE|Hmmm, I don’t think so.
JERRY’S APARTMENT-NEXT DAY|JERRY|Well, what does he do? Is he an artisan, a craftsman, a labourer of some sort?
JERRY’S APARTMENT-NEXT DAY|ELAINE|Wall street.
JERRY’S APARTMENT-NEXT DAY|JERRY|Ah, high finance. Bulls, Bears, people from Conneticut.
JERRY’S APARTMENT-NEXT DAY|ELAINE|And he happens to be pretty good lookin’.
JERRY’S APARTMENT-NEXT DAY|JERRY|(pause) All right, sir.
JERRY’S APARTMENT-NEXT DAY|ELAINE|And... he’s hilarious.
JERRY’S APARTMENT-NEXT DAY|JERRY|Now that’s not fair! So where did you meet this guy?
JERRY’S APARTMENT-NEXT DAY|ELAINE|I staked out his health club.
JERRY’S APARTMENT-NEXT DAY|JERRY|Uh huh. When you’re on a stakeout, do you find it’s better to stand up against the wall, or kinda crouch down behind a big plant?
JERRY’S APARTMENT-NEXT DAY|action|They leave his apartment
COMEDY CLUB – NIGHT|JERRY|Y’know I think that even if you’ve had a relationship with someone, or let’s say, especially if you’ve had a relationship with someone and you try to become friends afterwards, it’s very difficult. Isn’t this? It’s hard. Because, you know each other so well, you know all of each others tricks. It’s like two magicians, trying to entertain each other. The one goes, “Look, a rabbit.” The other goes, “So? I believe this is your card.” “Look, why don’t we just saw each other in half and call it a night, okay?”
