INT. JERRY'S CAR - DAY|GEORGE|Man, I'm starving.
INT. JERRY'S CAR - DAY|ELAINE|How can you be hungry after what you ate at that Mets game?
INT. JERRY'S CAR - DAY|GEORGE|Because ballpark food doesn't count as real food.
INT. JERRY'S CAR - DAY|JERRY|Right. It's just an activity. It's like that paddle with the ball and the rubber band.
INT. JERRY'S CAR - DAY|KRAMER|You know, my friend Bob Saccamano made a fortune off of those. See he came up with the idea for the rubber band. Before that, people would just hit the ball, and it would fly away.
INT. JERRY'S CAR - DAY|JERRY|I can't believe you all made me leave before the end of the game.
INT. JERRY'S CAR - DAY|ELAINE|Oh, come on, Jerry. It was 9 to nothing. We were getting shellacked.
INT. JERRY'S CAR - DAY|GEORGE|Those nachos are killing me.
INT. JERRY'S CAR - DAY|ELAINE|I thought you were hungry.
INT. JERRY'S CAR - DAY|GEORGE|It's complicated.
INT. JERRY'S CAR - DAY|KRAMER|Come on, Jerry, you're going to miss the exit.

INT. JERRY'S CAR - DAY|KRAMER|I'll tell you when you can go. Wait, wait, wait, Wait-- now, now, now. No, no, no. Go, go! No, no. Wait-- now, now! Now! Jerry! Go--ahh...
INT. JERRY'S CAR - DAY|action|Jerry swerves into another lane. Lamar, the driver of the maroon Golf honks the horn.
INT. JERRY'S CAR - DAY|JERRY|Oh, calm down, maroon Golf. He thinks I cut him off. He accelerated.
INT. JERRY'S CAR - DAY|KRAMER|You want me to moon him? Ooh, let's moon him. Roll up your window. Let's do a pressed ham under glass.
INT. JERRY'S CAR - DAY|ELAINE|Oh, no, I couldn't do that.
INT. JERRY'S CAR - DAY|KRAMER|Look at this, look at this. He's giving us the finger.
INT. JERRY'S CAR - DAY|ELAINE|Oh, all right.
INT. JERRY'S CAR - DAY|KRAMER|Yeah.
INT. JERRY'S CAR - DAY|action|Elaine and Kramer get up to moon Lamar.
INT. JERRY'S CAR - DAY|GEORGE|So I saw that new movie about the Hindenburg.

INT. JERRY'S CAR - DAY|JERRY|How was it?
INT. JERRY'S CAR - DAY|GEORGE|I found it morose. Why dwell on these negative themes?
INT. JERRY'S CAR - DAY|JERRY|Yeah. They should make a movie about all the Hindenburg flights that made it.
INT. JERRY'S CAR - DAY|GEORGE|Anyway, right in the middle, the ship blows up-- burning debris, bodies falling-- and then just as this eerie silence settles over the airfield, I yelled out, "That's gotta hurt!"
INT. JERRY'S CAR - DAY|JERRY|Heh.
INT. JERRY'S CAR - DAY|GEORGE|The place went nuts.
INT. JERRY'S CAR - DAY|JERRY|Imagine the laugh you could have gotten if you'd yelled that out at the actual disaster.
INT. JERRY'S CAR - DAY|GEORGE|Yeah.
INT. JERRY'S CAR - DAY|KRAMER|Why are we slowing down?
INT. JERRY'S CAR - DAY|action|Music plays in the background.
INT. JERRY'S CAR - DAY|JERRY|What is that music?
INT. JERRY'S CAR - DAY|GEORGE|What's with all these flags?
INT. JERRY'S CAR - DAY|JERRY|Oh, no.
INT. JERRY'S CAR - DAY|ELAINE|Ohh! Oh, the city shuts down Fifth avenue. They never let anyone through. We're never getting home.

INT. JERRY'S CAR - DAY|JERRY|See? If we had stayed, we could have seen those runs.
INT. JERRY'S CAR - DAY|GEORGE|I could have had some ice cream. I think that might have calmed down the nachos.
INT. JERRY'S CAR - DAY|ELAINE|I'm going to miss 60 Minutes. You know, I hate to miss 60 Minutes. It's part of my Sunday weekend wind-down.
INT. JERRY'S CAR - DAY|JERRY|I don't know how you can unwind with that clock ticking. It makes me anxious.
INT. JERRY'S CAR - DAY|KRAMER|All right, gentlemen, I scouted it out. I think we can get out over there.
INT. JERRY'S CAR - DAY|JERRY|But that's a one-way street coming this way. Besides, how am I gonna get all the way over there?

INT. JERRY'S CAR - DAY|JERRY|Maroon Golf.
INT. JERRY'S CAR - DAY|LAMAR|Where you goin', black Saab? You seem to be a tad askew.
INT. JERRY'S CAR - DAY|JERRY|Could you move your car back a little?
INT. JERRY'S CAR - DAY|LAMAR|Oh. Sorry. I seem to have cut you off.
