Setting: Jerry's apartment|JERRY|She's out.
Setting: Jerry's apartment|GEORGE|(Stops) Oh right, the blind date.
Setting: Jerry's apartment|JERRY|Yeah, well, they like to call it a set-up now. I guess the blind people don't like being associated with all those losers.
Setting: Jerry's apartment|GEORGE|Come on. Come check out my new place. It'll take you two minutes.
Setting: Jerry's apartment|JERRY|I can't. I'm meeting Kramer down at my mini-storage.
Setting: Jerry's apartment|GEORGE|(Gloating) Hey, you got any extra furniture down there? I need some more stuff to fill that extra bedroom with the walk-in closet. (Smiles)

Setting: Manhattan Mini-storage|JERRY|(Takes out his key to unlock the unit door) Where is your key?
Setting: Manhattan Mini-storage|KRAMER|Yeah, well, uh, Newman. He's - he's got it.

Setting: George's new apartment|GEORGE|(Let down) Yeah, but you - you promised it to me.
Setting: George's new apartment|RICARDI|Yes, but, you see - Mister Eldridge is an Andrea Doria survivor. And, in light of the terrible suffering that he's already been through, we've decided to give it to him.

Setting: Jerry's apartment|JERRY|Did you find out who stabbed him?
Setting: Jerry's apartment|ELAINE|Yeah, (Nodding) It turns out it was his ex-girlfriend.
Setting: Jerry's apartment|JERRY|(Like a father) Well, you're not going near this hooligan anymore.
Setting: Jerry's apartment|ELAINE|Well, I don't know.. I mean, think about it, Jerry. There must be something exciting about this guy if he can arouse that kind of passion. (Obviously turned on by the stabbing) I mean, to be stab-worthy.. You know, it's.. kind of a compliment.

Setting: Jerry's apartment|JERRY|There is now. Kramer, you should really get that cough checked out by a doctor.
Setting: Jerry's apartment|KRAMER|(Shrugging it off) Nah, no, no, no. No doctors for me. A bunch of lackeys and yes-men all towing the company line.. (Looks at Jerry, then leans in so Elaine can't hear) Plus, the botched my vasectimy.

Setting: Jerry's apartment|ELAINE|Andrea Doria? Isn't that the one they did the song about?
Setting: Jerry's apartment|JERRY|(Correcting her) Edmund Fitzgerald.
Setting: Jerry's apartment|ELANE|I love Edmund Fitzgerald's voice.
Setting: Jerry's apartment|JERRY|(Gives Elaine a look) No, Gordon Lightfoot was the singer. Edmund Fitzgerald was the ship.
Setting: Jerry's apartment|GEORGE|(Talking about his would-be apartment) You could fit 15 people in that bathroom..
Setting: Jerry's apartment|ELAINE|I think Gordon Lightfoot was the boat.
Setting: Jerry's apartment|JERRY|(Sarcastic) Yeah, and it was rammed by the Cat Stevens.

Setting: Newman's apartment|NEWMAN|I didn't get my transfer.
Setting: Newman's apartment|JERRY|"Transfer"?
Setting: Newman's apartment|NEWMAN|To Hawaii. The most sought-after postal route of them all. The air is so dewy-sweet you don't even have to like the stamps.. But it's not to be - So, I'm hanging it up.
Setting: Newman's apartment|JERRY|You quit the post office?
Setting: Newman's apartment|NEWMAN|Kind of. I'm still collecting checks, I'm just not delivering mail.
Setting: Newman's apartment|JERRY|Well, get it out of my storage. It's illegal.
Setting: Newman's apartment|NEWMAN|And yet, it's perfectly legal to take a man's soul and crush it out like a stale Pall Mall.

Setting: Restaurant|ELAINE|(Leans in close) Between you and me, what happened there with the stabbing?
Setting: Restaurant|ALAN|Just.. one of those things, you know.

Setting: Coffee shop|JERRY|Mmm.. Bad how?
Setting: Coffee shop|ELAINE|(Fast) Well, you know when you break up, how you say things you don't mean? Well, he says the mean things you don't mean, but he means them.
Setting: Coffee shop|JERRY|(Nods) I follow. So what are you gonna do?
Setting: Coffee shop|ELAINE|Dump him. I can't be with someone who doesn't break up nicely. I mean, to me, that's one of the most important parts of a relationship.

Setting: George's apartment building|ELDRIDGE|(Defensively) We had to abandon ship.
Setting: George's apartment building|GEORGE|Well, all vacations have to end eventually.
Setting: George's apartment building|ELDRIDGE|The boat sank.
Setting: George's apartment building|GEORGE|(Holding up Kramer's book) According to this, it took.. 10 hours. It eased into the water like an old man into a nice warm bath - no offence. (Pause) So, uh, Clarence, how about abandoning this apartment, and letting me shove off in this beauty?

(Every memeber of the board shows some sign that George's story is most deserving of the apartment. Ricardi is crying. George turns to leave, then remembers one more thing..) Oh, also.. my fiance died from licking toxic envelopes that I picked out. (Sobs and loud crying erupts from the board members) Thanks again. (Leaves. Eldridge looks defeated)
Setting: Newman's apartment|action|Jerry returns to get another bag of mail
Setting: Newman's apartment|JERRY|Hey, I've been trying to jam stuff in the box, like you told me, but sometimes it says, like, "Photographs - Do not bend".
Setting: Newman's apartment|NEWMAN|"Do not bend". (Laughs evilly) Just crease, crumple, cram.. you'll do fine. (Phone rings. Newman answers it) Hello?.. This is he. I don't understand.. very well. (Hangs up in disappointment)
Setting: Newman's apartment|JERRY|What?
Setting: Newman's apartment|NEWMAN|That was the Vice President of the post office. I didn't get the transfer.. They knew it wasn't me doing my route!
Setting: Newman's apartment|JERRY|How did they know?!
Setting: Newman's apartment|NEWMAN|(Stands up) Too many people go their mail! Close to 80%. No body from the post office has ever cracked the 50% barrier! It's like the 3-minute mile!
Setting: Newman's apartment|JERRY|(Pleading) I tried my best!
Setting: Newman's apartment|NEWMAN|Exactly. You're a disgrace to the uniform. (Newman takes off Jerry's mailman hat. Jerry turns his head in shame. Newman then tears the post office badge from Jerry's coat)
Setting: Newman's apartment|JERRY|You know, this is your coat.
Setting: Newman's apartment|NEWMAN|(Realizing) Damn!

Setting: Coffee shop|GEORGE|It's not contest. The guy had nothing! The ship went down, he got into a life boat, I mean, come on.
Setting: Coffee shop|JERRY|Boy, he didn't know what he was up against. (George laughs) So, when do you move into the apartment?
Setting: Coffee shop|GEORGE|They're making their decision today.
Setting: Coffee shop|action|Elaine enters. She has a scarf over her head - trying to tie her hair down. She looks angered at something
Setting: Coffee shop|JERRY|What's the matter with you?
Setting: Coffee shop|ELAINE|Nothing.. Except that a bird ran into my giant freak-head. (Sits down)
Setting: Coffee shop|JERRY|What giant freak-head?
Setting: Coffee shop|ELAINE|(Annoyed, near tears) The one that sits atop my disproportunately puny body.. I'm a walking candy apple!
Setting: Coffee shop|JERRY|So, it's actually gotten to you? You're playing right into his hands!
Setting: Coffee shop|ELAINE|(Realizing) What? Yeah.. you're right!.. All I have to do is call him up, and sit with him, and show him that it doesn't bother me. You know, laugh it off.. or jam a fork into his forehead.
Setting: Coffee shop|JERRY|(Casually, sarcastic) Either way.
Setting: Coffee shop|ELAINE|(Getting up to leave) Alright.
Setting: Restaurant|ALAN|I want to apologize for..
Setting: Restaurant|ELAINE|(Shrugging it off) Oh, please.
Setting: Restaurant|ALAN|So you have a big head.

Setting: Restaurant|ALAN|It goes well with that bump in your nose.
Setting: Restaurant|ELAINE|(Suddenly angry) What?!
Setting: Restaurant|action|Scene cuts to the outside of the restaurant. A woman runs out of the restaurant and stops a passing Kramer
Setting: Restaurant|WOMAN|Please! Get help! There's a crazy big-headed woman beating up some guy! Tell the police "The Old Mill Restaurant". Hurry!

Setting: Restaurant|COP|Boy, that's some cough you got there.
Setting: Restaurant|action|Kramer keeps coughing while making gestures
Setting: Restaurant|action|Kramer starts running back to the restaurant, the cops following him
Setting: George's apartment building|action|George enters the hallway only to find that a bandaged-up Alan is moving boxes into George's would-be-apartment
Setting: George's apartment building|GEORGE|Excuse me, uh, what are you doing in there?
Setting: George's apartment building|ALAN|I'm moving in. Alan Mercer. New neighbor. (They shake hands)
Setting: George's apartment building|GEORGE|What? Elaine's big-head guy? They have you the apartment?!
Setting: George's apartment building|ALAN|Yeah.
Setting: George's apartment building|GEORGE|Why?! Because you were stabbed, and.. got coffee thrown in your face, and.. uh.. (Points to Alan's bandaged forehead)
Setting: George's apartment building|ALAN|Oh, fork in the forehead.
Setting: George's apartment building|GEORGE|That's why they gave you the apartment?
Setting: George's apartment building|ALAN|No, I just gave the super 50 bucks.
Setting: George's apartment building|GEORGE|Wait a minute, that is my apartment. I earned it with 34 years of misery!
Setting: George's apartment building|ALAN|Tough luck, chinless. (Goes into his new apartment, and slams the door on George)
Setting: George's apartment building|action|George starts acting self-conscious about his chin - much like Elaine and her head
