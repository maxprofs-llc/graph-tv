Opening Monologue|JERRY|Aren't mannequins an insult to your imagination? You couldn't possibly visualize a sweater so we'll show you on this life size snotty puppet. I guess when they finish with them they become crash test dummies. That's the end of the line for a mannequin. "What ever happened to Bob?" "Have you seen that new Volvo commercial? He's got a bulls eye right in his face." Mannequins are only used for car accidents and fashion, I guess these are the two situations that it's impossible for us to imagine ourselves. Well dressed or getting killed. I'm sure there is some pro-mannequin organization that doesn't even like you to use the term mannequin. "Hey they're not mannequins, they're the life deprived."

Jerry's appartment, the next day|ELAINE|Get out!
Jerry's appartment, the next day|KRAMER|It's uncanny! It's like they chopped off your arms and legs, dipped you in plastic, and screwed you back all together again, and stuck you on a pedestal. It's really quite exquisite.
Jerry's appartment, the next day|GEORGE|Kramer, what's the name of the store with the mannequin?

Rinitze|action|George is looking at himself in the mirror and doesn't care about their dispute
Rinitze|ELAINE|What are you saying, that I'm not good enough for this hideous dress? (looking at her name tag) Listen Natasha... I wouldn't be caught dead wearing your crummy little euro-trash rags. (to George) I'll meet you outside.

Rinitze|SALESWOMAN|I'll tell you a little secret. We're having an unadvertised sale starting Friday, that suit will be half-price.
Rinitze|GEORGE|So you think you can put the suit aside and hold it for me?
Rinitze|SALESWOMAN|Oh, I'm afraid I could't do that. It wouldn't be fair to the other customers.
