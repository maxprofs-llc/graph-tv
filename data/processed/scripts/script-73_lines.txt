Setting: Night club|JERRY|If there's a serial killer lose in your neighborhood, it seems like the safest thing is to be the neighbor. They never kill the neighbor. The neighbor always survives to do the interview afterwards. Right? "Oh, he was kind of quiet." I love these neighbors. They're never disturbed by the sounds of murdering, just stereo. Chain saws, people screaming, fine. Just keep the music down. And all these women who always fall in love with the serial killer. They write to him in prison. Here's a woman that's hard to disappoint. I guess she's only upset when she finds out he's stopped killing people and she goes: "You know sometimes I feel like I don't even know who you are anymore".

setting: Elaine's office and Jerry's apartment|JERRY|No I haven't vomited in thirteen years.
setting: Elaine's office and Jerry's apartment|ELAINE|Get out!
setting: Elaine's office and Jerry's apartment|JERRY|Not since June 29, 1980.
setting: Elaine's office and Jerry's apartment|ELAINE|You remember the date?
setting: Elaine's office and Jerry's apartment|JERRY|Yes, because my previous vomit was also June 29th... 1972. That's why during the '80 vomit, I was yelling to George: "Can you believe it? I'm vomiting on June 29th again."
setting: Elaine's office and Jerry's apartment|ELAINE|Boy, you know when Joel told me he hadn't thrown up in eight years, I was wondering if he was normal.
setting: Elaine's office and Jerry's apartment|JERRY|No Elaine he's normal. Your boyfriend is a normal guy. He just happens to have the same name as one of the worst serial killers in the history of New-York.

setting: Jerry's|ELAINE|Hey, how many people did Rifkin strangle? Eighteen?
setting: Jerry's|JERRY|Yeah. Eighteen strangles.
setting: Jerry's|KRAMER|You know why Rifkin was a serial killer? Because he was adopted. (saying it as he's taking a lot of paper towels from Jerry's roll; Elaine and Jerry are confused at Kramer's statement) Just like Son of Sam was adopted. So apparently adoption leads to serial killing. (Kramer leaves and we don't know why he needed so much paper towels)
setting: Jerry's|ELAINE|You know Joel and I have an extra ticket to the Giants game.
setting: Jerry's|action|Jerry doesn't have the time to open his mouth before Kramer pops in again

setting: Jerry's|JERRY|Risotto. (we see a flashback from The Mango where Karen tells George that she feels full after a Risotto, as opposed to when she has sex with him)

setting: Jerry's|JERRY|Yeah. He's really got a good thing with her. In fact I'm doubling with them tonight.
setting: Jerry's|ELAINE|I tought you didn't like double dates.
setting: Jerry's|JERRY|George likes them, he feels it's a good personality showcase. He likes a date to see him with a friend so she can get a window into his nondate personality.
setting: Jerry's|ELAINE|I've looked through that window and screamed at him to shut the blinds.
setting: Jerry's|JERRY|He feels he's funnier, more relaxed.

setting: Jerry's|ELAINE|Hey, did you get a massage yet?
setting: Jerry's|JERRY|No! How many times do I have to go out with her before I get a massage?
setting: Jerry's|ELAINE|Jerry, she gives massages all day. She doesn't wanna to give them on dates.
setting: Jerry's|JERRY|Yeah I know... She just wants to have sex.

setting: Elaine's apartment|ELAINE|(repeating to hear how it sounds) Todd. (pause) No. Veto.
setting: Elaine's apartment|JOEL|All right. Oh, hey, I think you're gonna like my first my third choice.
setting: Elaine's apartment|ELAINE|Great...
setting: Elaine's apartment|JOEL|Alex.
setting: Elaine's apartment|ELAINE|I gotta tell ya, I have a bad association with the name Alex.
setting: Elaine's apartment|JOEL|Bad bad association?
setting: Elaine's apartment|ELAINE|Yeah, in college I sat next to an Alex in art history. And he was always drinking coffee and after every sip he would go: "Ahh". I mean every two seconds: "Ahh". And he would take like 40 sips and after everyone: "Ahh". I had to drop the class.

setting: Jerry's place|JODI|Hey.
setting: Jerry's place|JERRY|Hi.
setting: Jerry's place|JODI|Hi. (kiss) I was running late and I didn't have a chance to drop off my stuff before I came over.
setting: Jerry's place|JERRY|Ah, no problem. That's fine.
setting: Jerry's place|JODI|What's with this music?
setting: Jerry's place|JERRY|That's new age music. Sounds of the forest. I find it soothing. Hey, look at this! What do you know? A massage table! This is great! (he starts to install the table)
setting: Jerry's place|JODI|What are you doing?
setting: Jerry's place|JERRY|Just checking it out. Look at how this thing is made. Can I tell you something? That's a hell of a piece of equipment.
setting: Jerry's place|JODI|Actually, I should get a new one.
setting: Jerry's place|JERRY|No, nonsense. This one's fine. (as he sits on the table)
setting: Jerry's place|JODI|So, where do you wanna go? (as she puts her hand on his shoulder)
setting: Jerry's place|JERRY|Go? Why go anywhere? (as he places his hand over hers. She starts to massage his shoulders a little) Ahh, that feels good. Yeah. That's, uh... That's good. (he tries to go further. He grabs her hands over his shoulders and he lies down on the table on his chest) Yeah, that's nice. That's very nice.
setting: Jerry's place|JODI|(she stops massaging) No. No, this isn't good. I can't do this.
setting: Jerry's place|JERRY|Why, what's wrong? (he grabs her hands and force her to keep them on his shoulders)
setting: Jerry's place|JODI|I can't (she tries harder to pull her hands away)
setting: Jerry's place|JERRY|No. Yes you can. (he hangs on)
setting: Jerry's place|JODI|No, I can't!

setting: Karen's place|GEORGE|You know what? I should really go talk to her. Nothing confrontational. Just two adults sitting down trying to clear the air. You know, I just know if I could spend some time alone with her. I've got to. (he grabs his jacket) I've got to.
setting: Karen's place|KAREN|You're going now?
setting: Karen's place|GEORGE|I think I can still catch her.
setting: Karen's place|KAREN|All right George. I have had just about enough of this.
setting: Karen's place|GEORGE|What? What are you talking about.
setting: Karen's place|KAREN|I am talking about you and Jodi. You're completely obsessed with her!
setting: Karen's place|GEORGE|I know. I know.
setting: Karen's place|KAREN|Who is more important to you, her or me? I like you, she doesn't. Who are you gonna pick?
setting: Karen's place|GEORGE|(he thinks a little about it... and as he puts his hand on his knee and gets up) I'm sorry Karen. I know I care for you, but I just can't stand when someone doesn't like me. (he opens the door)

setting: back to Jerry's|JODI|No means no.
setting: back to Jerry's|JERRY|Look, who are you kidding? You come up to my apartment with your table and your little oils, and I'm not supposed to expect anything? You're a massage teaser.
setting: back to Jerry's|JODI|Listen. I massage who I want, when I want. I don't submit to forcible massage. (he tries desperately to get her hands on his shoulders again but she pulls them away immediately) I'm getting out of here.
setting: back to Jerry's|JERRY|Fine. Go.
setting: back to Jerry's|action|George enters. He's staring at Jodi
setting: back to Jerry's|GEORGE|Jerry, could you excuse us for a few minutes, please?
setting: back to Jerry's|JERRY|What for?
setting: back to Jerry's|GEORGE|We need to talk.
setting: back to Jerry's|JERRY|You need to talk?
setting: back to Jerry's|JODI|We have nothing to talk about.
setting: back to Jerry's|GEORGE|Look it's no secret what's going on between us. (to Jerry) She doesn't like me. Now Jerry if you don't mind.
setting: back to Jerry's|JERRY|George, anything you have to say to her, you can say in front of me.
setting: back to Jerry's|GEORGE|(he makes a sign to Jodi to wait and turns to Jerry) Jerry... This woman hates me so much. I'm starting to like her.
setting: back to Jerry's|JERRY|What?
setting: back to Jerry's|GEORGE|She just dislikes me so much... It's irresistable.
setting: back to Jerry's|JERRY|I can see that.
setting: back to Jerry's|JODI|I'm getting out of here. (to Jerry) Don't call me.
setting: back to Jerry's|JERRY|Don't worry. (she leaves)
setting: back to Jerry's|GEORGE|A woman that hates me this much comes along once in a lifetime.
setting: back to Jerry's|JERRY|You're a lucky guy.
setting: back to Jerry's|GEORGE|I got to go after her.

Closing Monologue|JERRY|The swedish are very big massagers. You know? They like the swedish meatballs, swedish massage. They like having meat in their hands these people, for some reason. But it's weird because they have the highest suicide rate, they're rubbing each other's necks all the time for a neutral country they seem kinda tense. I don't really like the idea of getting a professional massage. I don't want people touching me that don't know me and don't want to have sex with me. You know what are you bothering me for? You get me all loosened up, juices flowing, and then that's it ok, you're done. It's like having chocolate rubbed all over your face, you know you wanna go "Excuse me, I think you missed a spot."
