I've got two words to say to you, George hot tub. (George looks at him, puzzled)
New York marathon - Jerry, Elaine, Kramer|JERRY|I'm tellin'you, I never told anyone about that baby. I never even went near your building!
New York marathon - Jerry, Elaine, Kramer|ELAINE|Then how did she find out, Jerry?!
New York marathon - Jerry, Elaine, Kramer|JERRY|Maybe you should check with the rabbi.
New York marathon - Jerry, Elaine, Kramer|KRAMER|(to Elaine) You want some hot tea?
New York marathon - Jerry, Elaine, Kramer|ELAINE|Oh no, thank you.
New York marathon - Jerry, Elaine, Kramer|KRAMER|Oh. There's some runners. Here they come!
New York marathon - Jerry, Elaine, Kramer|action|The first runner to appear is Jean-Paul
New York marathon - Jerry, Elaine, Kramer|ELAINE|There's Jean-Paul! He's up front! He's leading! (jumping) Go Jean-Paul!(starts screaming)
New York marathon - Jerry, Elaine, Kramer|KRAMER|Oh yeah! Yeah! Come on! (starts howling)
New York marathon - Jerry, Elaine, Kramer|JERRY|Come on, let's go Jean-Paul!
New York marathon - Jerry, Elaine, Kramer|ELAINE|Go Jean-Paaaaaul!
New York marathon - Jerry, Elaine, Kramer|action|We switch over to Jean-Paul. We hear him breathing. We hear his heart beating. Some people offer him drinks. Jean-Paul grabs one, Kramer's hot tea, and leaves scene. Kramer gets very surprised. We then hear Jean-Paul screaming in pain, and it's not hard to guess why. Kramer puts on a "whatta hell" look, Elaine puts on an "ouch" look and Jerry puts on his "it's a shame" one.
George and Mr.Steinbrenner inside a hot tub|STEINBRENNER|How're you enjoying it, George? Melts that tension away, doesn't it? You gotta get that jet on the good spot. Oh. Oh. Uh. Uh. Yes, that feels good. Yes, that's real good. Oh yeah, that's where I keep all my tension. Right down to that chicken bone. Sometimes I get my wife to just stuck her thumb right in there like a screwdriver. Ya know, the Phillips head, not the flat one. Oh God, those flat ones frustrate me. You got it in, but it slips out. You put it in again, slips out again. You a single man, George?
George and Mr.Steinbrenner inside a hot tub|GEORGE|(bored to death) Well, I-I just recently uh...
George and Mr.Steinbrenner inside a hot tub|STEINBRENNER|I'll tell you, if you wanna get something wild goin'on in your life, you get a girl and bring her to one o'these things. Just like 4 shots a wild turkey. (laughs) She'll think you're Hopalong Cassidy. (George starts sliding, until he gets all his head -and glasses- under water, as Steinbrenner keeps talking) A show, about that Mickey Mantle, wasn't it? You know we used to talk. I don't think he liked me very much, you know.
