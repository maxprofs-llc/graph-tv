Opening monologue|JERRY|You don't understand. I got this all timed out. I got another spot across town at 9:50, I'm not gonna be able to make it!
Opening monologue|KERNIS|I hear you, guy.
Opening monologue|JERRY|And I'm doin' Letterman Monday. You know, I gotta work out the material!
Opening monologue|KERNIS|Why don't you come back and do the 11 o'clock spot?
Opening monologue|JERRY|No, I'm supposed to meet my friends to see this movie ``CheckMate'' at 10:30.
Opening monologue|BUCKLES|Hey, Jer!
Opening monologue|JERRY|[not losing a step] Heeeeyyyyyyyy..... [and out the door]
Opening monologue|GEORGE|Excuse me, do you have a ticket?
Opening monologue|MAN|No.
Opening monologue|GEORGE|Okay. Good.
Opening monologue|BUCKLES|Jerry!
Opening monologue|JERRY|What are  doing here?
Opening monologue|BUCKLES|Hey, do you think this is funny? ``Why do they call it athlete's foot? You don't have to be an athlete to get it. I mean, my father gets it all the time, and believe me, he's no athlete!''
Opening monologue|ELAINE|I've been *dying* to see ``CheckMate''.
Opening monologue|GEORGE|Well, if it's as good as ``Ponce de Leon'', I'll be happy.
Opening monologue|ELAINE|``Ponce de Leon'', are you kidding me? I hated that movie!
Opening monologue|GEORGE|``Ponce de Leon''? But that was great!
Opening monologue|ELAINE|Oh, . That Fountain of Youth scene at the end, where they're all splashin' around, and then they go running over to the mirror to see if it really worked? I mean, come on! [laughing too hard to continue] That's stupid!
Opening monologue|GEORGE|Lemme tell you sum'in. When Ponce looked in that mirror and saw that he hadn't changed, and that tear started to roll down his cheek? ... I lost it.
Opening monologue|KRAMER|Listen, I'm gonna get a hot dog at Payapa King.
Opening monologue|GEORGE|You're not going to get back here in time!
Opening monologue|KRAMER|I'm starvin', I haven't had any dinner!
Opening monologue|ELAINE|You can get a hot dog in the theater.
Opening monologue|KRAMER|I don't wanna get a movie hot dog! [in tears] I want a Papaya King hot dog!
Opening monologue|ELAINE|Kramer, Jerry is going to be here any second, and then this line is going to start moving, and we're going to end up in the front row.
Opening monologue|KRAMER|Well, just save me a seat.
Opening monologue|ELAINE|No! I don't want to save seats. Don't put me through that! I once had the fleece just ripped out of my winter coat in a seat-saving incident!
Opening monologue|GEORGE|I'm in line to buy.
Opening monologue|ELAINE|No, George, this is the ticket- line.
Opening monologue|GEORGE|No it's not, it's the ticket- line.
Opening monologue|ELAINE|Then how come we're not moving?
Opening monologue|KRAMER|Good question.
Opening monologue|GEORGE|Is this the ticket holders line, or the buyers?
Opening monologue|MAN|Holders.
Opening monologue|GEORGE|But I asked you before if you had a ticket, and you said no!
Opening monologue|MAN|I didn't. My friend was getting it.
Opening monologue|GEORGE|[furious] Good. It's good to be accurate like that.
Opening monologue|ELAINE|Can you believe him?
Opening monologue|KRAMER|He's spaced out.
Opening monologue|ELAINE|How long would *you* have stood in the ticket-holders line?
Opening monologue|KRAMER|[thinks for a while]
Opening monologue|ELAINE|[gives up] Yeah, exactly...
Opening monologue|ELAINE|I don't wanna go to a... miniplex multi-theater!
Opening monologue|GEORGE|It's the same movie! What's the difference?
Opening monologue|ELAINE|It's not a theater, it's like a room where they bring in POWs to show them propaganda films.
Opening monologue|JERRY|[to taxi driver] Take the Park!
Opening monologue|BUCKLES|No no no, take 55th.
Opening monologue|BUCKLES|Jerry, I want you to do me a favor. No more fish!
Opening monologue|JERRY|[rubbing his eyes hoping the nightmare will end] Okay, I get your point!
Opening monologue|BUCKLES|I had a point?
Opening monologue|GEORGE|Hey, you know what else is playing here? ``Rochelle Rochelle''.
Opening monologue|ELAINE|Sigh/Ugh.
Opening monologue|GEORGE|I wouldn't mind seein' .
Opening monologue|ELAINE|Yeah. You know, men can sit through the most boring movie if there's even the slightest possibility that a woman will take her top off.
Opening monologue|GEORGE|So what's your point?
Opening monologue|GEORGE|By the way, you owe me seven fifty.
Opening monologue|ELAINE|Oh, all right. Can you break a twenty?
Opening monologue|GEORGE|No, I don't have any change.
Opening monologue|ELAINE|Oh, well, then I'll pay you later.
Opening monologue|GEORGE|Or, I could take the twenty, then I could pay *you* later.
Opening monologue|ELAINE|Yeah, you *could*...
Opening monologue|GEORGE|Might be easier.
Opening monologue|ELAINE|I mean, how is that easier? I mean, then you would owe me twelve fifty instead of me owing you seven fifty.
Opening monologue|GEORGE|[trying to act as if he doesn't care one way or the other, but we know better] Either way.
Opening monologue|ELAINE|Yeah.
Opening monologue|GEORGE|So... Can I have it?
Opening monologue|ELAINE|I tell you what, I'll get the popcorn and the soda.
Opening monologue|GEORGE|Whaddya mean, you'll ``get'' the popcorn and the soda?
Opening monologue|ELAINE|I will buy your popcorn and soda. We'll call it even.
Opening monologue|GEORGE|I tell you what, you give me the twenty, and I will buy *you* a popcorn and soda, and I'll throw in a bon-bons.
Opening monologue|ELAINE|[exasperated] George, you're sappin' my strength.
Opening monologue|GEORGE|You go in and save seats.
Opening monologue|ELAINE|[in a panic] Me!? But that's three seats! I can't save three seats! I told you about that guy who tore up my winter coat!
Opening monologue|BUCKLES|Jerry, I want you to have this piece of material.
Opening monologue|JERRY|That's very nice of you, but I can't do the voices.
Opening monologue|BUCKLES|Jerry! Don't start up with me!
Opening monologue|JERRY|I gotta get out of this cab...
Opening monologue|BUCKLES|But Jerry, quit riffing!
Opening monologue|JERRY|No, I'm not riffing. I'm ignoring! Do you understand the difference?
Opening monologue|BUCKLES|[pause] Can you help me get on The Tonight Show?
Elaine does her best to save three seats.|ELAINE|No, these are saved.
Elaine does her best to save three seats.|MAN|All of them? C'mon, you can't take *four* seats.
Elaine does her best to save three seats.|ELAINE|What, is that a rule?
Elaine does her best to save three seats.|GEORGE|Well, why don't *you* go, and I could save the seats. You said you didn't like saving anyway.
Elaine does her best to save three seats.|ELAINE|[stopping someone from sitting in the seat next to her] No, *TAKEN*, Taken, taken. [to George] [shrugs] I'm getting the hang of it.
Elaine does her best to save three seats.|GEORGE|Why don't you give me the twenty, and I'll stop and get change, and then you and I can... uh... you-know, settle.
Elaine does her best to save three seats.|ELAINE|Can we do this later, George?
Elaine does her best to save three seats.|GEORGE|Psh. What's the point of even discussing it? [condescendingly takes her hand and pats it] You'll give me the money when you have it. [takes two steps, then reconsiders, then re-reconsiders] I, I trust you.
Elaine does her best to save three seats.|KRAMER|Could you do me a favor? If you see a guy that's five foot eleven, he's got uh a big head and flared nostrils, tell him his friend's going to be right back, okay?
Elaine does her best to save three seats.|ELAINE|No, I'm sorry, these are taken. ... They're in the lobby buying popcorn. ... What are you doing? These are taken, these are taken!
Elaine does her best to save three seats.|WOMAN|Which one?
Elaine does her best to save three seats.|ELAINE|These two and this one. ... No! Don't come over here! These are taken. Go! Go! These are taken! They're taken! THEY'RE TAKEN!!!
Elaine does her best to save three seats.|ELAINE|Oh, take 'em.
Elaine does her best to save three seats.|GEORGE|Um, excuse me, have you see a guy with like a horse face, big teeth, and a, and a pointed nose?
Elaine does her best to save three seats.|CLERK|... flared nostrils?
Elaine does her best to save three seats.|GEORGE|Yeah.
Elaine does her best to save three seats.|CLERK|Nope, haven't seen him.
Jerry gets out of the cab in front of the Paragon.|BUCKLES|Jerry, could you do me a personal favor? And if I'm out of line, *please*, let me know. Could I keep my trench coat in your closet for a few months?
Jerry gets out of the cab in front of the Paragon.|JERRY|Your trench coat in my closet?
Jerry gets out of the cab in front of the Paragon.|BUCKLES|Jerry, my closet is packed to the gills, I'm afraid to open the door. Just for a few months. It'll make all the difference in the world.
Jerry gets out of the cab in front of the Paragon.|BUCKLES|We should see ``Rochelle Rochelle''. I hear it's really hot.
Jerry gets out of the cab in front of the Paragon.|JERRY|No thanks, maybe some other time.

Jerry gets out of the cab in front of the Paragon.|JERRY|No, I don't.
Jerry gets out of the cab in front of the Paragon.|BUCKLES|You liked the athlete's foot bit, right?
Jerry gets out of the cab in front of the Paragon.|JERRY|No. No. I was kidding. It's terrible.

Jerry gets out of the cab in front of the Paragon.|CLERK|Haven't seen him. There was a short guy with glasses... Looked like Humpty-Dumpty with a melon hat. But he left.
Jerry gets out of the cab in front of the Paragon.|WOMAN|So I got home, and he was vacuuming! I mean, he's twelve years old! Who else but my Alan would do something like that?
Jerry gets out of the cab in front of the Paragon.|WOMAN|And then last night, he put on my high heels. Oh, he put on such a show for us! He was dancing around, lip-sync'ing to ``A Chorus Line'', I mean you can see he's got talent.
Jerry gets out of the cab in front of the Paragon.|ELAINE|[annoyed] Excuse me, excuse me.
Jerry gets out of the cab in front of the Paragon.|WOMAN|What's the problem?
Jerry gets out of the cab in front of the Paragon.|ELAINE|[momentarily shocked, as if the answer were self-evident] You're talking.
Jerry gets out of the cab in front of the Paragon.|WOMAN|It's the ``Coming Attractions''.
Jerry gets out of the cab in front of the Paragon.|WOMAN|So anyway, he sings, he dances. And do you know what he's gotten into now? He is cooking! He does a crepe...
