Opening Monologue|JERRY|You can always tell what was the best year of your father's life, because they seem to just freeze that clothing style and just ride it out to the end, don't they? And it's not like they don't continue shopping, it's just they somehow manage to find new old clothes. Every father is like this fashion time capsule, you know what I mean. It's like they should be on a pedestal, with someone next to 'em going 'This was nineteen sixty-five'. To me the worst thing is shopping for pants. I hate dressing and undressing in that little room. What men need is a place to shop where you go in, you check your pants at the door, and you just walk around the store in your underwear. That would be the best way. Then you'd really have to lie to the salesman. 'Need some help?' 'No, just getting some air.'
George's parents' house|action|Elaine and Jerry in the living room.
George's parents' house|JERRY|How would you describe the smell in this house?

George's parents' house|KRAMER|Egh. These aren't candies.
George's parents' house|GEORGE|Wha? Did you use those? These are guest soaps! (he grabs the soaps and begins examining them for damage)
George's parents' house|KRAMER|Well I'm a guest.
George's parents' house|GEORGE|Now my parents are gonna know I had people over.
George's parents' house|JERRY|You're not allowed to have people over?

George's parents' house|ELAINE|Yeah. And she broke up with the vitamin guy.
George's parents' house|JERRY|(interested) Really?
George's parents' house|ELAINE|I'll put in a good word for you.
George's parents' house|JERRY|Thanks, because I would really like... (distractedly puts coffee cup back on the table)
George's parents' house|GEORGE|(screaming) Aaahh!!
George's parents' house|JERRY|Alright, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. (picks it up again)
George's parents' house|GEORGE|But Jerry, this is not coming out!
George's parents' house|JERRY|Just put a coffee table book over it.
George's parents' house|GEORGE|My parents don't read! They're gonna wonder what a book is doing on the table!

George's parents' house|GEORGE|Alright, Jerry, I'm gonna get my coat.
George's parents' house|JERRY|I'm sorry Elaine, I'll make it up to you.
George's parents' house|ELAINE|I need something to read on the subway.
George's parents' house|JERRY|(handing her a magazine) Here, read this.
George's parents' house|ELAINE|(looks at it) TV Guide?

Subway train|KRAMER|Oh, Queensboro Plaza. (reties his shoelaces) This stop is famous for its gyros, you want one?
Subway train|ELAINE|How are you gonna get something and get back on the train in time?

Subway train|RICKY|Highlighter?
Subway train|ELAINE|Excuse me?
Subway train|RICKY|To highlight the programmes you plan to watch.
Subway train|ELAINE|Ah. Uh, look really (looks about to try and avoid contact) I'm just trying to read.

Subway train|action|The train about to leave, the doors begin to close. As they do, Kramer tries to enter. The door closes, trapping his arm at the shoulder, leaving him holding his gyro into the carriage.
Subway train|KRAMER|(yells) Elaine!
Subway train|action|A passenger walking down the carriage grabs the gyro from Kramer's hand and sits down to eat it. Kramer extracts his arm and the doors slam closed.
Subway train|RICKY|Guess your boyfriend'll have to catch the next train.
Subway train|ELAINE|He's not my boyfriend.
Subway train|RICKY|He's not? (thoughtful) Interesting.

George's parents' house|RICKY|I made this for you.
George's parents' house|ELAINE|(accepts reluctantly) Oh, thank you.
George's parents' house|FRANK|(examining magazine) What is this? You got stains all over it! What the hell'd you do?
George's parents' house|RICKY|Hey, you can't talk to her like that.
George's parents' house|FRANK|(yelling) I'll talk to her any way I want!
George's parents' house|RICKY|Come on Elaine, let's go.
George's parents' house|action|As Ricky strides over to Elaine, he catches the coffee table with his leg. It tips up with the weight of the TV Guide collection and falls over with a crash.
George's parents' house|ESTELLE|My coffee table!
Gus' Smoke Shop|action|Kramer is stands beside the Indian in the cigar store, trying to do a job of salesmanship. The guy behind the counter doesn't look impressed. In the background, Mr Lippman is browsing.
Gus' Smoke Shop|KRAMER|I don't understand. How can you have a cigar store, without an Indian? It's unseemly.
Gus' Smoke Shop|SPIKE|I'll give you a box of Coronas for it.
Gus' Smoke Shop|KRAMER|Forget it.
Gus' Smoke Shop|LIPPMAN|Uh, excuse me. Are you uh, selling this Indian?
Gus' Smoke Shop|KRAMER|Oh yeah, yeah.
Gus' Smoke Shop|LIPPMAN|Uh, I'm just uh, redecorating my office in a south-western motif and this'd be perfect. Give you five hundred dollars for it?
Gus' Smoke Shop|KRAMER|Giddyup.
Gus' Smoke Shop|LIPPMAN|Yeah? Could you help me bring it up to my office, I'm right next door. Pendant Publishing.
Gus' Smoke Shop|KRAMER|Pendant Publishing? Giddyup again.

Lippman's office|KRAMER|Yeah, hi Elaine.
Lippman's office|ELAINE|What are you doing in here with that?
Lippman's office|KRAMER|Ah, well, it's a business transaction.
Lippman's office|LIPPMAN|(entering, smoking a cigar and with a handful of cash) Listen uh, petty cash just had tens and twenties. (hands cash to Kramer) Go ahead, count it.
Lippman's office|KRAMER|Yeah, I'm sure it's all here. (puts in in his pocket) You know I was just admiring your coffee table, out there in the hall.
Lippman's office|LIPPMAN|You like that, huh? I had that custom made for me in Santa Fe.
Lippman's office|KRAMER|You mind if I use it in my book?
Lippman's office|LIPPMAN|What book?
Lippman's office|KRAMER|Well, I'm doing a coffee table book on coffee tables.
Lippman's office|LIPPMAN|About coffee tables?
Lippman's office|action|Elaine is pulling skeptical faces.
Lippman's office|KRAMER|Uh huh.
Lippman's office|LIPPMAN|That's fantastic. (Elaine looks gobsmacked) Who's your publisher?
Lippman's office|KRAMER|Well, I'm still shopping it around.
Lippman's office|LIPPMAN|Yeah? (to Elaine) You see, this is the kind of idea you should be coming in with. What the hell do you do round here all day anyway?
Lippman's office|ELAINE|Well I (indistinct) ...manuscript that I...
Lippman's office|LIPPMAN|(ignoring Elaine) God, that Indian really completes the room. Don't you think?
Lippman's office|action|Elaine looks sick.

Furniture refinishers|ESTELLE|It's mine. I'm his mother.
Furniture refinishers|SYLVIA|Oh, I haven't seen George for a while. He must be working very hard.
Furniture refinishers|ESTELLE|George doesn't work. He's a bum. That's why he lives at home with us.
Furniture refinishers|SYLVIA|He does?
Subway train|action|Jerry and Elaine sit together on the train. Elaine still looks unhappy. Jerry has a copy of the TV Guide.
Subway train|JERRY|I don't know why we didn't think of this before. We just could call TV Guide.
Subway train|ELAINE|I dunno.
Subway train|JERRY|Well, it's gonna make Mr Costanza very happy. (he hands the magazine to Elaine)
Subway train|ELAINE|I guess.
Subway train|JERRY|What's the matter?
Subway train|ELAINE|What d'you think is the matter? I've been assigned to work on Kramer's coffee table book.
Subway train|JERRY|It is a good idea, Elaine.
Subway train|JERRY|You want a gyro?
Subway train|ELAINE|I don't think so.
Subway train|action|Jerry jumps up and rushes out of the door, pushing his way past other commuters.
Subway train: moments later|action|Elaine sits alone in her seat. Jerry tries to enter the carriage just as the doors close. They close on his arm, trapping it.
Subway train: moments later|JERRY|Elaine!
Subway train: moments later|action|A guy walking through the carriage picks the gyro out of Jerry's hand, just as Jerry pulls his arm free. He sits down opposite Elaine, preparing to eat.
Subway train: moments later|ELAINE|He's not my boyfriend.
Subway train: moments later|action|Elaine gets a flicker of recognition. She lifts up the TV Guide and finds the guy opposite her is the same guy pictured on the cover, Al Roker. She looks up at the real guy again and he has the exact expression as the picture on the cover.
Nightclub|JERRY|I was always excited as a kid, when that new TV Guide would come. Somehow when that front cover's nice and flat, seems like there's good fresh TV shows in. Then, as the weeks go by you start to hate the TV Guide. All the shows stink. Everything's getting all crumpled and ripped from being sat on, thrown across the room. TV Guide is always thrown, never handed, to another person. It's the world's most thrown reading material. 'Where's TV Guide?' (mimes throwing) 'There it is.' You know in the back of the TV Guide, they have a phone number, ninety-five cents a minute, they will give you the answers to the TV Guide crossword puzzle? My question is, if you can't do the TV Guide crossword puzzle, where are you coming across ninety-five cents?
