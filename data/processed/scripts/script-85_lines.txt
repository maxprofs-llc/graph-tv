Jerry's Car|KRAMER|All right, get off at the next exit.
Jerry's Car|JERRY|Kramer, I've driven to east Hampton many times, I know the exit.
Jerry's Car|KRAMER|It's a great house, pool, sun deck? Yeah, I'll be there.
Jerry's Car|JERRY|(To Elaine) You sure we're makin' the right move?
Jerry's Car|ELAINE|We gotta see the new baby anyway, at least we'll get a weekend in the Hamptons out of it.
Jerry's Car|JERRY|Didn't they just have a baby?
Jerry's Car|ELAINE|That was two years ago, remember? 'Jeh-Ree, you gotta see the Bay-Bee! You gotta see the Bay-Bee!'
Jerry's Car|JERRY|Is it possible they're just having babies to get people to visit them?
Jerry's Car|KRAMER|Hey Jerry, you ever wear silk underwear?
Jerry's Car|JERRY|No.
Jerry's Car|KRAMER|Put that on the top of your list.
Jerry's Car|JERRY|No, not for me. A little too delightful. Well, George and Jane should be almost there by now.
Jerry's Car|ELAINE|Oh, isn't that weird that George and Jane haven't had sex yet, but they're spending a weekend together?
Jerry's Car|JERRY|I know, George is pretty pleased about it. It's like she signed a letter of intent.
Jerry's Car|ELAINE|When's Rachel comin' out?
Jerry's Car|JERRY|She's makin' the three o'clock train.
Jerry's Car|ELAINE|Her father is so religious, I'm just amazed that he's letting you see her again after that Schindler's List make-out session.
Jerry's Car|JERRY|I bought him some kishka.
Jerry's Car|KRAMER|What's that?
Jerry's Car|JERRY|It's kind of a stuffed meat thing. Israeli soldiers carry it. In case they're captured behind enemy lines, they eat it and it kills them.
Jerry's Car|action|Elaine laughs
George and Jane in another car driving to the Hamptons.|GEORGE|I never tasted a cough medicine I didn't love.
George and Jane in another car driving to the Hamptons.|JANE|Me too. I love cough medicine.
George and Jane in another car driving to the Hamptons.|GEORGE|You see? We were made for each other. (Thinking to himself) It's amazing. If I reach out and touch her breast right not, she'd scream and throw me out of the car. But at this time tomorrow, I could touch it all I want.
George and Jane in another car driving to the Hamptons.|JANE|What's your favorite?
George and Jane in another car driving to the Hamptons.|GEORGE|Potussan. Ever try it with club soda?
George and Jane in another car driving to the Hamptons.|JANE|No.
George and Jane in another car driving to the Hamptons.|GEORGE|Oh, very refreshing. (Thinking again) Sex is like joining a private club. I'll be the same me tomorrow, but suddenly, the no trespassing sign will be gone.
George and Jane in another car driving to the Hamptons.|JANE|Are we almost there?
George and Jane in another car driving to the Hamptons.|GEORGE|Yeah, about ten, fifteen minutes. But I have to stop at a vegetable stand.
George and Jane in another car driving to the Hamptons.|JANE|What for?
George and Jane in another car driving to the Hamptons.|GEORGE|My mother loves Hampton tomatoes. She's nuts for Hampton tomatoes.
George and Jane in another car driving to the Hamptons.|JANE|Can you buy 'em later? I really wanna get some... sun.
George, Jane, Kramer, and Jerry outside of the house in the back.|KRAMER|Hey Jerry. Rub some lotion on my back.
George, Jane, Kramer, and Jerry outside of the house in the back.|JERRY|Who are you, Mrs. Robinson?
George, Jane, Kramer, and Jerry outside of the house in the back.|KRAMER|Come on, I'll rub some on yours.
George, Jane, Kramer, and Jerry outside of the house in the back.|JERRY|No, that's no sweet'ning the deal. No.
George, Jane, Kramer, and Jerry outside of the house in the back.|GEORGE|(To Jane) You know, when I was a kid, I once found a dollar and fifty cents in change on the bottom of the pool.
George, Jane, Kramer, and Jerry outside of the house in the back.|JANE|(No feeling in her voice) You must've been excited.
George, Jane, Kramer, and Jerry outside of the house in the back.|GEORGE|Yeah. Hey, you know, I gotta go get these tomatoes. You wanna go for a ride?
George, Jane, Kramer, and Jerry outside of the house in the back.|JANE|I don't think so.
George, Jane, Kramer, and Jerry outside of the house in the back.|GEORGE|'Kay. I'll uh, I'll see you later. Anybody want some tomatoes?
George, Jane, Kramer, and Jerry outside of the house in the back.|JERRY|No thanks.

George, Jane, Kramer, and Jerry outside of the house in the back.|JANE|I'm gonna take a dip. (She leaves for beach, Elaine enters with a shady hat on)
George, Jane, Kramer, and Jerry outside of the house in the back.|JERRY|And then there's Maude. (She sits down next to Jerry)
George, Jane, Kramer, and Jerry outside of the house in the back.|ELAINE|Look at my face, look at it. You see any lines?
George, Jane, Kramer, and Jerry outside of the house in the back.|JERRY|No lines.
George, Jane, Kramer, and Jerry outside of the house in the back.|ELAINE|You know why? One word: shade.
George, Jane, Kramer, and Jerry outside of the house in the back.|JERRY|So when are we gonna see this baby? When is the momentous event?
George, Jane, Kramer, and Jerry outside of the house in the back.|ELAINE|I don't know. They're takin' a nap or something.
George, Jane, Kramer, and Jerry outside of the house in the back.|KRAMER|I'm gonna go see if there are any girls on the beach. Elaine, you wanna come?
George, Jane, Kramer, and Jerry outside of the house in the back.|ELAINE|(Sarcastic) No thanks. I got plenty of girlfriends.

George, Jane, Kramer, and Jerry outside of the house in the back.|ELAINE|What?

George, Jane, Kramer, and Jerry outside of the house in the back.|JERRY|This is weird wild stuff. George hasn't even seen her yet.
George, Jane, Kramer, and Jerry outside of the house in the back.|ELAINE|Why do you think we're getting the sneak preview?
George, Jane, Kramer, and Jerry outside of the house in the back.|KRAMER|Maybe she's trying to create a buzz.
George, Jane, Kramer, and Jerry outside of the house in the back.|ELAINE|What?
George, Jane, Kramer, and Jerry outside of the house in the back.|KRAMER|You know, get some good word of mouth goin'.
George, Jane, Kramer, and Jerry outside of the house in the back.|JERRY|Oh, here she comes. (They pretend to not have watched as Jane enters)

George, Jane, Kramer, and Jerry outside of the house in the back.|CAROL|Isn't he gorgeous? (Elaine looks at baby, only to be frightened and turn away)
George, Jane, Kramer, and Jerry outside of the house in the back.|ELAINE|Ugghh.
George, Jane, Kramer, and Jerry outside of the house in the back.|CAROL|Is she gorgeous? (Elaine and Jerry looking away)
George, Jane, Kramer, and Jerry outside of the house in the back.|ELAINE|Oh, gorgeous, yes.
George, Jane, Kramer, and Jerry outside of the house in the back.|JERRY|So very gorgeous.

George, Jane, Kramer, and Jerry outside of the house in the back.|action|Cut to Kramer on the beach with some girls, then using a metal detector, then seeing a rope leading to something he doesn't know of yet.
George, Jane, Kramer, and Jerry outside of the house in the back.|action|Jerry and Elaine gasping for air outside after they just left the baby's room.
George, Jane, Kramer, and Jerry outside of the house in the back.|JERRY|Is it me or was that the ugliest baby you have ever seen?
George, Jane, Kramer, and Jerry outside of the house in the back.|ELAINE|Uh, I couldn't look. It was like the Pekinese.
George, Jane, Kramer, and Jerry outside of the house in the back.|JERRY|Boy, a little too much chlorine in that gene pool. (They sit) And, you know, the thing is, they're never gonna know, no one's ever gonna tell them.
George, Jane, Kramer, and Jerry outside of the house in the back.|ELAINE|Oh, you have to lie.
George, Jane, Kramer, and Jerry outside of the house in the back.|JERRY|It's a must lie situation.
George, Jane, Kramer, and Jerry outside of the house in the back.|ELAINE|Yes, it's a must lie situation.
George, Jane, Kramer, and Jerry outside of the house in the back.|JERRY|You know, I don't think we should tell George we saw Jane topless.
George, Jane, Kramer, and Jerry outside of the house in the back.|ELAINE|No, I don't think so.
George, Jane, Kramer, and Jerry outside of the house in the back.|JERRY|In fact remind me to tell Kramer too.
Cut to Kramer reeling in a box of lobster on the ocean.|KRAMER|Oooh, lobsters.
Carol and the baby's doctor with the baby|BEN|Oh this ointment should do it.
Carol and the baby's doctor with the baby|CAROL|How are you feeling, Adam? (She sees Elaine in the hall) Elaine! (Elaine enters) This is our pediatrician, Ben Feffa.
Carol and the baby's doctor with the baby|ELAINE|Hi.
Carol and the baby's doctor with the baby|CAROL|Look at him, Elaine. How gorgeous is he? I ask you, how gorgeous?

Carol and the baby's doctor with the baby|BEN|Elaine, you have children?
Carol and the baby's doctor with the baby|ELAINE|Me? Oh no, but I'd love to have a baby, I mean, I can't wait to have a baby. I'm just dyin' to have a baby.
Carol and the baby's doctor with the baby|BEN|A beautiful woman like you should. You're quite breathtaking.
Carol and the baby's doctor with the baby|ELAINE|Breathtaking? I'm breathtaking?
Carol and the baby's doctor with the baby|CAROL|And he's very particular. Ben, you're staying tonight, right?
Carol and the baby's doctor with the baby|BEN|Uh, Sure. (Elaine celebrates to herself as Jerry enters and quickly looks away from the baby)

Jerry and Rachel outside|RACHEL|Train was so crowded. I had to sit in the seat facing the wrong way.
Jerry and Rachel outside|JERRY|Oh I like that. It's like going back in time. (George comes outside)
Jerry and Rachel outside|GEORGE|Hey Rachel!
Jerry and Rachel outside|RACHEL|(Quickly gets out of seat) Hi. I'm gonna go in there to change.
Jerry and Rachel outside|action|She leaves
Jerry and Rachel outside|GEORGE|What kind of a greeting was that?
Jerry and Rachel outside|JERRY|She's got greeting problems.
Jerry and Rachel outside|GEORGE|Yeah. I love Hampton tomatoes. You know, you can eat 'em like apples. You know it's funny, the tomato never really took on as a hand fruit.
Jerry and Rachel outside|JERRY|Well, the tomato's an anomaly. So successful with the ketchup and the sauce, but you can't find a good one. (Kramer enters with a box of lobster)
Jerry and Rachel outside|KRAMER|Hey, hey, hey! Look at what I got!
Jerry and Rachel outside|GEORGE|Hey! Wow, the K-Man! (They walk into the kitchen inside)
Jerry and Rachel outside|JERRY|You got lobster for everybody?
Jerry and Rachel outside|KRAMER|Yeah, and they're fresh! Right out of the ocean.
Jerry and Rachel outside|GEORGE|This is fantastic. Man, what a weekend. Swimming, lobster for dinner...
Jerry and Rachel outside|KRAMER|I know, it's great. And I saw Jane topless. (Jerry shows that 'damn' expression behind George)
Jerry and Rachel outside|GEORGE|You saw who, what?
Jerry and Rachel outside|KRAMER|Yeah, I saw Jane topless. Well, we all saw her.
Jerry and Rachel outside|JERRY|(Jerry realizes the situation is hopeless) All right.
Jerry and Rachel outside|GEORGE|You saw Jane topless?
Jerry and Rachel outside|JERRY|Well, when you went for the tomatoes she lied out topless.
Jerry and Rachel outside|GEORGE|Oh you mean face down on her chest.
Jerry and Rachel outside|JERRY|No.
Jerry and Rachel outside|GEORGE|Face up on her back?
Jerry and Rachel outside|JERRY|Yeah.
Jerry and Rachel outside|GEORGE|Well why'd she do that?
Jerry and Rachel outside|KRAMER|I guess she was hot.
Jerry and Rachel outside|GEORGE|You mean she just laid there topless?
Jerry and Rachel outside|KRAMER|No, no, she got up, she walked around...
Jerry and Rachel outside|GEORGE|Walked around? And you looked?
Jerry and Rachel outside|KRAMER|Of course. She's got a great body, buddy. All right, I'm gonna go upstairs, I'll be right back.
Jerry and Rachel outside|GEORGE|I can't believe that you saw her before me.
Jerry and Rachel outside|JERRY|Think of me as a doctor. (They go outside again)
Jerry and Rachel outside|GEORGE|Well, how good a look did you get?
Jerry and Rachel outside|JERRY|Well what'd you mean?
Jerry and Rachel outside|GEORGE|Well, if she was a criminal and you had to describe her to a police sketch artist...
Jerry and Rachel outside|JERRY|They'd pick her up in about ten minutes.
Jerry and Rachel outside|GEORGE|Great, great. So anytime you want you can just visualize her naked.
Jerry and Rachel outside|JERRY|(looking of into the distance) I guess that's true...
Jerry and Rachel outside|GEORGE|Stop it, stop it! It's not fair. It's not fair. I don't like this situation, Jerry. I don't like it one bit.
Jerry and Rachel outside|JERRY|What do you want me to do? You wanna see Rachel naked?
Jerry and Rachel outside|GEORGE|Yes, yes! The punishment should fit the crime.
Jerry and Rachel outside|JERRY|You can see me naked. I can offer you that.
Jerry and Rachel outside|GEORGE|It's like I'm Neil Armstrong. I turn around for a sip of Tang and you jump out first.
Jerry and Rachel in their room, with Elaine there as well|ELAINE|Nobody ever called me breathtaking before.
Jerry and Rachel in their room, with Elaine there as well|JERRY|I've never been called breathtaking either.
Jerry and Rachel in their room, with Elaine there as well|ELAINE|I mean, if he thinks that that baby's breathtaking, then who's not breathtaking?
Jerry and Rachel in their room, with Elaine there as well|JERRY|Maybe he just said it because the mother was in the room.
Jerry and Rachel in their room, with Elaine there as well|ELAINE|Yeah, right, that's a possibility. I have to find out.
Jerry and Rachel in their room, with Elaine there as well|JERRY|How are you gonna do that?
Jerry and Rachel in their room, with Elaine there as well|ELAINE|I can be very clever.
Jerry and Rachel in their room, with Elaine there as well|RACHEL|I'm gonna take a swim.
Jerry and Rachel in their room, with Elaine there as well|ELAINE|Oh, me too. I'll meet you down. (She goes in the hall and sees George) Oh, don't go in, Rachel's getting undressed.
Jerry and Rachel in their room, with Elaine there as well|GEORGE|Oh, okay. (Starts to walk other way and then walks to their room and goes in)
Jerry and Rachel in their room, with Elaine there as well|RACHEL|Hey!
Jerry and Rachel in their room, with Elaine there as well|GEORGE|Oh, sorry.
Jerry and Rachel in their room, with Elaine there as well|RACHEL|Don't you knock?
Jerry and Rachel in their room, with Elaine there as well|GEORGE|I'm sorry, uh, it's not like I'm gonna see something I've never seen before.
Jerry and Rachel in their room, with Elaine there as well|JERRY|You might have.
Jerry and Rachel in their room, with Elaine there as well|GEORGE|I didn't.
Jerry and Rachel in their room, with Elaine there as well|JERRY|You won't.
Jerry and Rachel in their room, with Elaine there as well|RACHEL|What'd you want anyway, George?
Jerry and Rachel in their room, with Elaine there as well|JERRY|Yes, George. I'm kind of wondering myself. What is it what you want?
Jerry and Rachel in their room, with Elaine there as well|GEORGE|No, I was just wondering... if you guys, uh, had any gum.
Jerry and Rachel in their room, with Elaine there as well|JERRY|Oh! So you were swimming in the pool, and you wanted some gum.
Jerry and Rachel in their room, with Elaine there as well|GEORGE|Yes, because the water was cold... and the chewing warms me up.
Jerry and Rachel in their room, with Elaine there as well|RACHEL|We don't have any gum.
Jerry and Rachel in their room, with Elaine there as well|GEORGE|Okay. (Chewing) Thanks anyway. (Continues to chew as he exits)
Jerry and Rachel in their room, with Elaine there as well|RACHEL|Strange man.
Jerry and Rachel in their room, with Elaine there as well|JERRY|Wait'll you get to know him.
Jerry and Rachel in their room, with Elaine there as well|RACHEL|So where is this baby, anyway?
Jerry and Rachel in their room, with Elaine there as well|JERRY|Oh, check it out. I guarantee you've never seen anything quite so objectionable. It's down the hall, third door on your left. (Rachel walks down hall, walks in on George changing out of his swimsuit)
Jerry and Rachel in their room, with Elaine there as well|RACHEL|(She screams) Oh my God! I'm sorry, I thought this was the baby's room. I'm really sorry. (She exits)
Jerry and Rachel in their room, with Elaine there as well|GEORGE|(realizing he was short changed) I was in the pool! I was in the pool!
Jerry and George talking in Jerry's room|GEORGE|Did she do it on purpose?
Jerry and George talking in Jerry's room|JERRY|It was my fault, I told her the wrong door.
Jerry and George talking in Jerry's room|GEORGE|I was supposed to see her. She wasn't supposed to see me.
Jerry and George talking in Jerry's room|JERRY|So what?
Jerry and George talking in Jerry's room|GEORGE|Well ordinarily I wouldn't mind. But...
Jerry and George talking in Jerry's room|JERRY|But...
Jerry and George talking in Jerry's room|GEORGE|Well I just got back from swimming in the pool. And the water was cold...
Jerry and George talking in Jerry's room|JERRY|Oh... You mean... shrinkage.
Jerry and George talking in Jerry's room|GEORGE|Yes. Significant shrinkage.
Jerry and George talking in Jerry's room|JERRY|So you feel you were short changed.
Jerry and George talking in Jerry's room|GEORGE|Yes! I mean, if she thinks that's me she's under a complete misapprehension. That was not me, Jerry. That was not me.
Jerry and George talking in Jerry's room|JERRY|Well, so what's the difference?
Jerry and George talking in Jerry's room|GEORGE|What if she discusses it with Jane?
Jerry and George talking in Jerry's room|JERRY|Oh, she's not gonna tell Jane.
Jerry and George talking in Jerry's room|GEORGE|How do you know?
Jerry and George talking in Jerry's room|JERRY|Women aren't like us.
Jerry and George talking in Jerry's room|GEORGE|They're worse! They're much worse than us, they talk about everything! Couldn't you at least tell her about the shrinkage factor?
Jerry and George talking in Jerry's room|JERRY|No, I'm not gonna tell her about your shrinkage. Besides, I think women know about shrinkage.
Jerry and George talking in Jerry's room|GEORGE|How do women know about shrinkage?
Jerry and George talking in Jerry's room|JERRY|Isn't it common knowledge?
Jerry and George talking in Jerry's room|GEORGE|Do women know about shrinkage?
Jerry and George talking in Jerry's room|ELAINE|What do you mean, like laundry?
Jerry and George talking in Jerry's room|GEORGE|No.
Jerry and George talking in Jerry's room|JERRY|Like when a man goes swimming... afterwards...
Jerry and George talking in Jerry's room|ELAINE|It shrinks?
Jerry and George talking in Jerry's room|JERRY|Like a frightened turtle!
Jerry and George talking in Jerry's room|ELAINE|Why does it shrink?
Jerry and George talking in Jerry's room|GEORGE|It just does.
Jerry and George talking in Jerry's room|ELAINE|I don't know how you guys walk around with those things.

Everyone at the dinner table eating Kramer's lobster.|GEORGE|What're you doing? What're you, telling secrets? What're you laughing at?
Everyone at the dinner table eating Kramer's lobster.|JANE|It's nothing, George.

Everyone at the dinner table eating Kramer's lobster.|KRAMER|Well, I found this rope and I kept tugging on it, and all these lobsters came up.
Everyone at the dinner table eating Kramer's lobster.|MICHAEL|Those are commercial lobster traps. You can't take those lobsters from there. That's against the law.
Everyone at the dinner table eating Kramer's lobster.|KRAMER|Take it easy. There's plenty of lobsters in the ocean for everyone.
Everyone at the dinner table eating Kramer's lobster.|MICHAEL|My father was a lobsterman. He got up every morning at four and came home every night stinking of brine! He sent me through law school with the lobsters he caught! (Kramer stands up from table)

Out on the porch, Ben and Elaine|ELAINE|Well, to tell you the truth, Dr. Feffa, I , I was surprised to hear you use a word like breathtaking to describe a baby, I mean, because you also used it referring to me.
Out on the porch, Ben and Elaine|BEN|Well, you know Elaine, sometimes you say things just to be nice. (Elaine relieved, then confused, not knowing if he was being nice to her or to the baby)
Rachel and Jerry in their room|JERRY|You told her?
Rachel and Jerry in their room|RACHEL|Yeah, what's the big deal?
Rachel and Jerry in their room|JERRY|You don't understand. This organ, it's very... schizophrenic.
Rachel and Jerry in their room|RACHEL|Jerry, what the difference? You know, you're the ones obsessed with this stuff, not us. I'm sure it wouldn't matter to Jane.
