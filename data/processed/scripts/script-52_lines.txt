Back at JFK, George and Kramer check out the Arrivals board (again)|GEORGE|What, are you, nuts? You're gonna spend more on the ticket than you're gonna get back from Grossbard.
Back at JFK, George and Kramer check out the Arrivals board (again)|KRAMER|No, I'm not gonna use the ticket! I'm gonna get my money, I'll get off the plane and turn your ticket in for a refund. It's not gonna cost you a dime! Now gimme the card.
Back at JFK, George and Kramer check out the Arrivals board (again)|GEORGE|This is a *great* idea! Here... use this one. I get frequent flyer miles with every purchase... Wait! Get two tickets. As long as your turning it in for a refund what's the difference? I'll get *double* the bonus miles.
Back in coach, Elaine returns to her seat now that the attendant is done serving.|ELAINE|Excuse me. I'm sorry to make you do this, but I got stuck in the aisle and the flight attendant wouldn't let me get through. There's no way to get around that cart...
Back in coach, Elaine returns to her seat now that the attendant is done serving.|ELAINE|I'll try and remember that. [Pause] Where's my meal?
Back in coach, Elaine returns to her seat now that the attendant is done serving.|ELAINE|Excuse me? Excuse me, but I didn't get a meal.

Back in coach, Elaine returns to her seat now that the attendant is done serving.|ELAINE|Kosher meal? I don't want a kosher meal. I don't even know what a kosher meal is.

Back at JFK|KRAMER|Look, I got Super Savers! C'mon.
Back at JFK|GEORGE|Super Savers? Are they refundable!?
Back at JFK|GEORGE|You bought non-refundable tickets, you idiot!
Back at JFK|KRAMER|She talked me in to it-- she said it was the best deal.
Back at JFK|GEORGE|Do you know how much this is going to cost me?
Back at JFK|KRAMER|Look, I'll tell you what-- I'll split it with you
Back at JFK|GEORGE|Look, I'm gonna go to the bathroom...
Back at JFK|action|Kramer goes forward and confronts Grossbard. For his part, Grossbard doesn't seem to recognise Kramer from twenty years ago (then again, he apparently had short hair at the time). After trying in vain to reach Grossbard's wallet, Kramer is escorted off the plane. Before this can take place, George knocks on the bathroom door to a reply of ``Just a minute'' from the occupant inside (I bet he stinks). Anyway, the door opens and, surprise! It's the Prisoner without his Time magazine (at least now we know why he needed it so badly-- reading material for the john). Anyway, the guy pulls George into the bathroom (he's still wearing his cuffs and shackles, BTW (that's got to make it rather difficult to go to the bathroom, but I digress)). So, while George is in the can with the serial killer, Kramer is escorted off the plane. Don't worry-- the plane isn't moving yet. And what's up with going to the bathroom on a non-moving plane? Isn't there laws against that? Or is it just trains that you have to wait until they're moving? Who really cares, anyway?
