setting: night club|JERRY|To me, the whole concept of fear of success is proof that we are definitely scraping the bottom of the fear barrel. Are we gonna have to have AA-type meetings for these people? They'll go: "Hi, my name is Bill, and the one thing I'm worried about is to have a stereo and a cream-colored couch." According to most studies, people's number-one fear is public speaking. Number two is death. *Death* is number two! Now, this means to the average person, if you have to go to a funeral, you're better off in the casket than doing the eulogy.
setting: Jerry's|action|Jerry is entering his apartment, following by Kramer
setting: Jerry's|KRAMER|Why can't I play Kramer?
setting: Jerry's|JERRY|Look we've been through this already. You're not an actor!
setting: Jerry's|KRAMER|Neither are you.
setting: Jerry's|JERRY|I know. So why do we need two people in the show that can't act?
setting: Jerry's|KRAMER|Oh come on Jerry. How hard is it to act. You say something, I'll pretend it's funny.
setting: Jerry's|JERRY|My grandmother's in the hospital.
setting: Jerry's|KRAMER|Ha ha ha. Your grandmother's in the hospital!
setting: Jerry's|JERRY|This is real believable.
setting: Jerry's|KRAMER|What you didn't think I was really laughing?
setting: Jerry's|JERRY|It stinks.
setting: Jerry's|KRAMER|Let me see you do it.
setting: Jerry's|JERRY|Say something funny.
setting: Jerry's|KRAMER|Alright. I've never been to Mars but I imagine it's quite lovely.
setting: Jerry's|JERRY|Ah..........
setting: Jerry's|KRAMER|Mine was better than that! Come on look. (starts to laugh again, Jerry too)
setting: Jerry's|action|George enters while they're both laughing
setting: Jerry's|GEORGE|Why are two pretending to be laughing?
setting: Jerry's|JERRY|We're acting. (they stop laughing)
setting: Jerry's|GEORGE|Oh, real good. (George makes a face like: you stink) Any word from NBC?
setting: Jerry's|JERRY|No.
setting: Jerry's|GEORGE|I don't understand. They're supposed to be casting this week. Something's wrong. Maybe they're not doing it.
setting: Jerry's|KRAMER|(to Jerry) Well at least let me audition.
setting: Jerry's|JERRY|(to George) He wants to play Kramer in the Pilot.
setting: Jerry's|KRAMER|(to George) Yeah!
setting: Jerry's|GEORGE|Out of the question.
setting: Jerry's|KRAMER|Oughh!

setting: Peter McManus cafe, an Italian restaurant|RUSSELL|I really appreciate you coming.
setting: Peter McManus cafe, an Italian restaurant|ELAINE|Oh, that's O.K. I don't have much time though. So...
setting: Peter McManus cafe, an Italian restaurant|RUSSELL|All right, first of all, I want to apologize for all the phone calls. It's just--It's just-- (awkward pause) I don't understand, we went out once...
setting: Peter McManus cafe, an Italian restaurant|ELAINE|That was two months ago.
setting: Peter McManus cafe, an Italian restaurant|RUSSELL|Yes I know. I just-- I can't get you out of my mind. Ever since that-- that day in the restaurant when we met... (we see a flashback from 'The Shoes' of Elaine showing her cleavage and asking Russell for his Ketchup secret)
setting: Peter McManus cafe, an Italian restaurant|ELAINE|Russell, you are the president of NBC. You can have any woman you want. (picks up the bowl of munchies on the table)
setting: Peter McManus cafe, an Italian restaurant|RUSSELL|But I want you.
setting: Peter McManus cafe, an Italian restaurant|ELAINE|God I hate these mixtures. Why don't they just put pretzels on the table. Even peanuts would be good, but I don't know how eats these cheesy things (she does).
setting: Peter McManus cafe, an Italian restaurant|RUSSELL|Is it something I said... or did?
setting: Peter McManus cafe, an Italian restaurant|ELAINE|Um... Look Russell... You're a very sweet guy. But I got to be honest with you. I don't like television... and that's your world. That's your life. I mean maybe if you were in... I don't know... Greenpeace or something, that would be different, but network television... I mean, come on, Russell, you're part of the problem.
setting: Peter McManus cafe, an Italian restaurant|RUSSELL|Oh Elaine, we're doing some really very interesting things right now. We've got some very exciting pilots for next season. We have one with a bright young comedian, Jerry Seinfeld.
setting: Peter McManus cafe, an Italian restaurant|ELAINE|Oh yeah, oh yeah. I've heard of him. He's that "Did you ever notice this? Did you ever notice that?" guy.
setting: Peter McManus cafe, an Italian restaurant|RUSSELL|Yeah. Anyway it's a ground breaking show.
setting: Peter McManus cafe, an Italian restaurant|ELAINE|Really? What is it about?
setting: Peter McManus cafe, an Italian restaurant|RUSSELL|(a little more enthusiast) Well, really, it's very unusual. It's about nothing.
setting: Peter McManus cafe, an Italian restaurant|ELAINE|(surprised) What do you mean it's about nothing?
setting: Peter McManus cafe, an Italian restaurant|RUSSELL|(starts doing George at the first meeting with NBC in 'The Pitch') For example, what did you do today?
setting: Peter McManus cafe, an Italian restaurant|ELAINE|Um, I got up. Um, I went to work. Then I came here.
setting: Peter McManus cafe, an Italian restaurant|RUSSELL|There's a show. that's a show.
setting: Peter McManus cafe, an Italian restaurant|ELAINE|Russell, see, I'm really not interested in this stuff and I do have to go to work (she gets up). So...
setting: Peter McManus cafe, an Italian restaurant|RUSSELL|(stops doing George, he's down again) Elaine, When--when--when are we gonna see each other again.

setting: Jerry's|action|Kramer sits down and starts to talk on the phone
setting: Jerry's|JERRY|(to George) Again with the sweat pants?
setting: Jerry's|GEORGE|What? I'm comfortable.
setting: Jerry's|JERRY|You know the message you're sending out to the world with these sweat pants? You're telling the world: "I give up. I can't compete in normal society. I'm miserable, so I might as well be comfortable." (George is baffled)
setting: Jerry's|KRAMER|(to the phone) Hold on a second I got another call. Hello? Yeah, he'll call you back. (Jerry and George look at each other)
setting: Jerry's|JERRY|(to Kramer) Who is it?
setting: Jerry's|KRAMER|That's NBC.
setting: Jerry's|JERRY|NBC!?! Give me the phone!
setting: Jerry's|KRAMER|I'm in the middle of a conversation here.
setting: Jerry's|JERRY|Get off the phone!
setting: Jerry's|KRAMER|(to the phone) Look, I'll call you back. (hangs up)
setting: Jerry's|JERRY|You know I'm waiting to hear from them. Who was it?
setting: Jerry's|KRAMER|Russell Dalrimple's secretary.
setting: Jerry's|JERRY|All right. Now you're doing something to help me. (to the phone) Hello yeah it's Jerry Seinfeld returning the call. Uh-huh.. O.K. great thanks a lot.

setting: Dana's office|DANA|That'd be wonderful George, you'll be rich and successful.

setting: Dana's office|DANA|I thought you didn't believe in God?
setting: Dana's office|GEORGE|I do for the bad things.
setting: Dana's office|DANA|Do you hear what you're saying? God isn't out to get you George. What... What is that on your lip?
setting: Dana's office|GEORGE|What?
setting: Dana's office|DANA|It's like a discoloration. It's white.
setting: Dana's office|GEORGE|(gets up and picks a mirror) Yes. Yes, it's white. Why it's white.
setting: Dana's office|DANA|You'd better get that checked out.
setting: Dana's office|GEORGE|Better get that checked out?
setting: Dana's office|DANA|I would.
setting: Dana's office|GEORGE|What kind of a therapist are you? I'm telling I'm scared that something terrible is gonna happen to me, right away you start looking for tumors?
setting: Dana's office|DANA|I'm trying to help you.
setting: Dana's office|GEORGE|What are you like a sadist? No matter how bad somebody feels, you can make 'em feel worse. I bet you're rooting for a tumor. (pointing to her)

setting: Jerry and George in a cab at a light|GEORGE|Catch what in time?
setting: Jerry and George in a cab at a light|JERRY|Whatever it is.
setting: Jerry and George in a cab at a light|GEORGE|You think it's something?

setting: NBC|GEORGE|(to Jay) What do you think it is?
setting: NBC|JAY|It's like a... white discoloration. (we understand now why a sitcom needs so many producers)
setting: NBC|JERRY|Yeah, where is Russell? I thought he was gonna be here.
setting: NBC|action|George sits down next to Stu and Jay, and grabs a magazine and the box of raisins. Jerry walks over to Goerge and sits next to him.
setting: NBC|STU|Oh you know I don't know. I saw him in the hall this morning, I said hello to him. He walked right past me.
setting: NBC|JAY|He must be worried about the fall schedule.
setting: NBC|STU|Ah, it's a real bear.
setting: NBC|GEORGE|Yeah. So what's going on? We're gonna shoot the pilot and then it's gonna be on TV the following week?

setting: NBC|MARK|Hey how you doing?
setting: NBC|JERRY|(thinking) They've gotta be kidding.
setting: NBC|GEORGE|(thinking) This guy's perfect.
setting: NBC|MARK|Anyone call for Vandelay Industries? (George is the only one in the room to find Mark funny)
setting: NBC|MARK|Listen to me. I told the unemployment office I was close to a job with Vandelay Industries and I gave them your phone number. So, when you answer the phone now, you've got to say: "Vandelay Industries".
setting: NBC|MARK|Right.

setting: NBC|GEORGE|No, not a loser!

setting: NBC|JERRY|No you didn't. He knows he's bald.
setting: NBC|MELISSA|So how about that guy wearing sweat pants? I mean did he do that for the part or does he walk around like that? (Jerry approves with a nod, George drops his notepad on the coffee table)
setting: NBC|JERRY|(getting up) Uh, you know what? I'll read with her.
setting: NBC|MELISSA|Oh, great.

setting: NBC|MELISSA|Yeah.
setting: NBC|JERRY|O.K.
setting: NBC|MELISSA|Ahem. What was that look?
setting: NBC|JERRY|What look?
setting: NBC|MELISSA|That look you just gave me?
setting: NBC|JERRY|I gave a look?
setting: NBC|MELISSA|Yes.
setting: NBC|GEORGE|Thank you! Thank you very much. (Jerry and Melissa stop and look at George)
setting: NBC|action|We see many short scenes with a wide variety of fat, tall, or small actors opening the door like Kramer does. Finally enters Tom Pepper, the guy that will get the role o Kramer
setting: NBC|ALL|Hi. How you doing?

setting: NBC|GEORGE|Did he just steal the raisins?
setting: NBC|STU|You think he stole them?
setting: NBC|JERRY|(to Kramer) What are you doing here?

setting: NBC|KRAMER|That's true.
setting: NBC|action|Jerry and George look at each other. They're gonna let Kramer have a shot at it. Kramer unfold the script and smile at Jerry and George, very confident.
setting: NBC|KRAMER|(acting very bad) I saw Joe DiMaggio in Dinky Doughnuts again, but this time, I went in. (pause, stops acting) Oh! Uh, where's the bathroom?
setting: NBC|STU|I think if you go down the hall, it's on the right at the very end.
setting: NBC|KRAMER|Yeah. Be right back. (Kramer leaves)
setting: NBC|action|We see Kramer, groaning and holding his stomach, running down the hall, and opening the bathroom's door. Someone in there says: "Sorry buddy, full house." We then see Kramer outside leaving the building and running across the street to a restaurant: "Sorry, customers only" ...running into a movie theater: "Hey you need a ticket!" ...running through the park...

setting: Monk's|ELAINE|Really?
setting: Monk's|JERRY|Yes.
setting: Monk's|ELAINE|Who is it?
setting: Monk's|JERRY|She's an eskimo, actually.
setting: Monk's|ELAINE|Oh, my God (not in the mood to be kidding)
setting: Monk's|JERRY|She came down from Juno by sleigh, she was in the Iditarod. Got to the finish line, just kept going. She's got the dogs with her in the hotel room.
setting: Monk's|ELAINE|Listen, was Russell at the casting?
setting: Monk's|JERRY|No, he didn't show up.
setting: Monk's|ELAINE|You know, I'm a little bit worried about him. I don't understand. We had one date two months ago. Am I that charming and beautiful?
setting: Monk's|JERRY|No. No you're not.
setting: Monk's|ELAINE|Why do I keep setting you up?
setting: Monk's|JERRY|I don't know.
setting: Monk's|ELAINE|(to the waitress) Could we get a little more? (she doesn't listen and walks away) Aghh... You know ever since this new owner took over, the service here is *really* slow.
setting: Monk's|JERRY|Yeah. Have you noticed anything else that's different since the new management?
setting: Monk's|ELAINE|Mmm. They're putting a little lemon in the tuna. I love that.
setting: Monk's|JERRY|Beside that. Look at the waitresses.
setting: Monk's|ELAINE|Yeah? (we see that all the waitresses have big breasts)
setting: Monk's|JERRY|What physical characteristic would you say is common to all of them?
setting: Monk's|ELAINE|Ah...
setting: Monk's|JERRY|I mean look at this. Every waitress working here has the same proportions. Wouldn't you say?
setting: Monk's|ELAINE|Yes, I would say.
setting: Monk's|JERRY|What's going on here. How is that possible?
setting: Monk's|ELAINE|Do you think it's a coincidence?
setting: Monk's|JERRY|No. I haven't seen four women like this together outside of a Russ Meyer film.
setting: Monk's|action|the waitress finally came with the coffee
setting: Monk's|ELAINE|(to the waitress) Hi. Excuse me. Who does all the hiring waitresses here?
setting: Monk's|WAITRESS|He does. (pointing to the manager, Mr. Visaki) In fact we're looking for another girl if you know anyone. (she walks away)
setting: Monk's|ELAINE|You know what? That's discriminatory. That is unfair. Why should these women have all the advantages? It's not enough they get all the attention from men, they have to get all the waitress jobs, too?
setting: Monk's|JERRY|Hey that's life. Good-looking men have the same advantages. You don't see any handsome homeless.

setting: Jerry's|JERRY|What did he say?
setting: Jerry's|GEORGE|He said he didn't know what it was.
setting: Jerry's|JERRY|Alright. So?
setting: Jerry's|GEORGE|When I asked him if it was cancer, he didn't give me a "get outta here". That's what I wanted to hear: "Cancer? Get outta here?"
setting: Jerry's|JERRY|Well, maybe he doesn't have a "get outta here" kind of personality.
setting: Jerry's|GEORGE|How could you be a doctor and not say "get outta here"? It should be part of the training at medical school: "Cancer? Get outta here!" "Go home! What are you crazy? It's a little test. It's nothing. You're a real nut. You know that?" (Jerry gives him half of his sandwich to hopefully shut him up) I told you that God would never let me be successful. I never should've written that pilot. Now the show will be a big hit, we'll make millions of dollars, and I'll be dead. Dead Jerry. Because of this. (showing his lip)
setting: Jerry's|JERRY|Can't you at least die with a little dignity?
setting: Jerry's|GEORGE|No I can't. I can't die with dignity. I have no dignity. I want to be the one person who doesn't die with dignity. I live my whole life in shame. Why should I die with dignity?

setting: Jerry's|GEORGE|You got mugged?
setting: Jerry's|JERRY|Mugged?
setting: Jerry's|KRAMER|Well, I wouldn't have minded it so much but I was running home to go to the bathroom.
setting: Jerry's|JERRY|Why didn't you use the bathroom in the building?
setting: Jerry's|KRAMER|It was full. I tried a few other places, you know, but that didn't work. I mean it was an emergency Jerrry. I was really percolating... So I decided to run home through the park and then these two guys they stopped me and...

setting: Jerry's|JERRY|Yeah?

setting: Jerry's|KRAMER|Well, I waited so long I-- I missed my chance.
setting: Jerry's|JERRY|You didn't go?
setting: Jerry's|KRAMER|No. And now I can't get it back.
setting: Jerry's|action|George gives back the sandwich to Jerry and goes to the bathroom
setting: Jerry's|JERRY|The % thing to do is just not think about it.

setting: Jerry's|GEORGE|(to Jerry) Have you seen the waitresses in there lately? I never had so much coffee in my life.
setting: Jerry's|ELAINE|So we decided I should go over there and apply for a job myself.
setting: Jerry's|GEORGE|Apply for a job? What for?
setting: Jerry's|ELAINE|Because, it's discriminatory (she comes back wearing one of Jerry's shirts, untucked)
setting: Jerry's|GEORGE|It's a coincidence.
setting: Jerry's|JERRY|This is what you gonna wear?
setting: Jerry's|ELAINE|Yeah.
setting: Jerry's|JERRY|You're not gonna get the job.
setting: Jerry's|ELAINE|Exactly.
