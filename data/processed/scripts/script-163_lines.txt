Kruger's. Kramer is examining Mr. Kruger.|KRAMER|Well, he's got a mole on his shoulder. Very suspicious.
Kruger's. Kramer is examining Mr. Kruger.|GEORGE|So, tell him you're concerned about it and he should see someone else.
Kruger's. Kramer is examining Mr. Kruger.|KRAMER|George, why would I, a Juilliard trained dermatologist, send him to another doctor?
Kruger's. Kramer is examining Mr. Kruger.|GEORGE|Because, you're not a dermatologist.
Kruger's. Kramer is examining Mr. Kruger.|KRAMER|He thinks I am. I'm not gonna betray that trust. Here's what I wanna do; I think I can get a section...
Kruger's. Kramer is examining Mr. Kruger.|GEORGE|Whoa, whoa, a section?!

5A. Jerry and George|JERRY|So, Kramer pulled it off?
5A. Jerry and George|GEORGE|Yep, and the photo was all fixed and back on his desk, no thanks to you.
5A. Jerry and George|JERRY|Well, that woman had it coming to her. Look at my neck, it looks like I had a beard of bees!
5A. Jerry and George|GEORGE|Why don't you see someone about it?
5A. Jerry and George|JERRY|I've called everyone. You know how hard it is to get a dermatologist in this town? (Kramer comes in) A real dermatologist.
5A. Jerry and George|KRAMER|(Points to a page on the book) Squamous cell carcinoma.
5A. Jerry and George|GEORGE|You're not a doctor. You shouldn't even have books like this.
5A. Jerry and George|KRAMER|George, that's what he has and I have to give him a call. Now we gotta came clean.
5A. Jerry and George|GEORGE|You can't tell him the truth, you're gonna blow the whole thing.
5A. Jerry and George|KRAMER|I don't want this on my conscience.
5A. Jerry and George|GEORGE|I'll get him to see a real doctor. You just stay away from this.
5A. Jerry and George|KRAMER|Yeah, alright...
5A. Jerry and George|JERRY|Hey, I wonder if they have a picture of my rash in here.
5A. Jerry and George|KRAMER|They've got everything there, Jerry. I underlined the best parts.
5A. Jerry and George|JERRY|Hey, this looks like the thing I have. Caused by exposure to benzene, a common ingredient in metal cleaners.
5A. Jerry and George|action|Kramer cleans the blade with some liquid and a towel.
5A. Jerry and George|KRAMER|Well, that's weird.
5A. Jerry and George|JERRY|What are you doing?
5A. Jerry and George|KRAMER|Well, I'm cleaning my slicer.
5A. Jerry and George|JERRY|That's my hand towel! I use that on my face, hands and chest! That's where the hives are coming from! It's not from Dr. Sitarides, it's from Dr. Van Nostrand!
5A. Jerry and George|KRAMER|So, somehow the Bronzo (?) is reacting to the poison she's giving you.
5A. Jerry and George|JERRY|Alright, get out. And take your Bronzo with you (throws the bottle to Kramer.)
5A. Jerry and George|KRAMER|Ohh, that's toxic. (Jerry throws the towel over Kramer's head.) Ououou....
Kruger's office|KRUGER|George, come in. I'm just going over our annual report...boy did we take it on the chin last year.
Kruger's office|GEORGE|Eh, listen Mr. Kruger, I got a message from Dr. Van Nostrand and he says it might be wise to you to see another doctor about that mole.
Kruger's office|KRUGER|I'm not too worried about it.
Kruger's office|GEORGE|Well, he said it could be cancer, maybe you should get it checked out.
Kruger's office|KRUGER|George, take a look at this photo. This is taken 10 years ago. That mole looks exactly as it does today. So, there's no cause for concern, eh?
Kruger's office|GEORGE|Whatever.
Kruger's office|KRUGER|Actually, funny thing about this photo. We were at the beach and there was this dumb looking guy near by. When he went in for a swim, my sons and I took all his stuff and threw it in the ocean! What a pear shaped loser.
Kruger's office|GEORGE|Well, that pear shaped loser was me! And I was in that photo, until I broke in here, stole the photograph and airbrushed myself out of there!
Kruger's office|KRUGER|Well, I'll be...you have lost a lot of hair.
Kruger's office|GEORGE|That's what they tell me!
Kruger's office|KRAMER|Do you want more pastrami?
Kruger's office|ELAINE|Um, what was that last thing you gave me? That was pretty good.
Kruger's office|KRAMER|Yeah, it was olive loaf. You want that?
Kruger's office|JERRY|I can't believe Kruger didn't fire you after all you did.
Kruger's office|GEORGE|He said he didn't care. Oh, God I love that place. Hey, have you seen other dermatologist?
Kruger's office|JERRY|Yeah, I finally got to see Dr. Kazarian. He said it was really bad.
Kruger's office|GEORGE|What did he give you for it.
Kruger's office|JERRY|Aloe. So where's that lock smith?
Kruger's office|GEORGE|Have to give him time on this hour.
Kruger's office|ELAINE|Can I have a zip? (Sticks a straw out from keyhole.)
Kruger's office|KRAMER|Oh yeah, coming up...
