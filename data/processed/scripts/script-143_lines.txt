Kramer, and Jackie begin to discuss their to tobacco representative, Ms. Wilkie.|JACKIE|Rugged? The man's a goblin. He's only been exposed to smoke for four days. By the time this case gets to trial, he'll be nothing more than a shrunken head.

Elaine's Apartment|ELAINE|Congratulations! You passed!
Elaine's Apartment|BEN|Elaine, Elaine. I don't think we should see each other anymore.
Elaine's Apartment|ELAINE|What? you're breaking up with me? But I sacrificed and supported you while you struggled. What about my dream of dating a doctor?
Elaine's Apartment|BEN|I'm sorry, Elaine. I always knew that after I became a doctor, I would dump whoever I was with and find someone better. That's the dream of becoming a doctor.
Elaine's Apartment|ELAINE|Look it, are we going to have sex, or not?

Jerry talking on the phone with David Letterman.|LETTERMAN|those things, deadly dangerous. A long time ago my uncle and a date are driving, like, through Mexico. They see one on the road, drags him out of the road, and chews his face off. Listen, we'll call you if anything opens up. Okay, Jimmy?
Jerry talking on the phone with David Letterman.|JERRY|Jerry.
Jerry talking on the phone with David Letterman.|LETTERMAN|Right. Jerry.
