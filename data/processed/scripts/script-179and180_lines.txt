Jerry and George at Monks|GEORGE|I can't eat this without catsup. Would it kill her to check up on us? Would that be a terrible thing? "How's everything? Do you need anything? What can I do for you?"
Jerry and George at Monks|JERRY|I know what you mean.
Jerry and George at Monks|GEORGE|Do ya?

Jerry and George at Monks|JERRY|To see a movie.
Jerry and George at Monks|GEORGE|I've been to the movies.
Jerry and George at Monks|JERRY|Not this movie.

Jerry and George at Monks|JERRY|Did you shower today?
Jerry and George at Monks|GEORGE|Yeah.
Jerry and George at Monks|JERRY|That's usually the kind of mood I'm in when I haven't showered.
Jerry and George at Monks|GEORGE|When is it going to be my turn, Jerry? When do I get my 15 minutes? I want my 15 minutes!
Jerry and George at Monks|JERRY|Oh, quit complaining. At least you have your health.
Jerry and George at Monks|GEORGE|Ah! Health's not good enough. I want more than health. Health's not doing it for me anymore. I'm sick of health.

Jerry and George are walking down the sidewalk. Kramer and Elaine drive up.|ELAINE|Why?
Jerry and George are walking down the sidewalk. Kramer and Elaine drive up.|JERRY|You can't make a health inquiry on a cell phone. It's like saying "I don't want to take up any of my important time in my home so I'll just get it out of the way on the street."
Jerry and George are walking down the sidewalk. Kramer and Elaine drive up.|GEORGE|On-the-street cell-phone call is the lowest phone call you can make.

Jerry and George are sitting in a waiting room at NBC|GEORGE|I will not blow this.
Jerry and George are sitting in a waiting room at NBC|JERRY|If he says he doesn't want it to be a show about nothing, don't go nuts.

Jerry and George are sitting in a waiting room at NBC|GEORGE|nothing
Jerry and George are escorted into Mr. Kimbrough's office|RECEPTIONIST|Mr. Kimbrough.
Jerry and George are escorted into Mr. Kimbrough's office|STU|Hey, Jerry, good to see you.
Jerry and George are escorted into Mr. Kimbrough's office|GEORGE|Hey, hey, hey!
Jerry and George are escorted into Mr. Kimbrough's office|STU|How you been?
Jerry and George are escorted into Mr. Kimbrough's office|JERRY|Good, good. You remember George.
Jerry and George are escorted into Mr. Kimbrough's office|STU|George, good to see you.
Jerry and George are escorted into Mr. Kimbrough's office|GEORGE|Hello Stu.
Jerry and George are escorted into Mr. Kimbrough's office|STU|You remember Jay Crespi.
Jerry and George are escorted into Mr. Kimbrough's office|GEORGE|Jay Crespi, how am I gonna forget Jay Crespi?
Jerry and George are escorted into Mr. Kimbrough's office|STU|This is James Kimbrough.
Jerry and George are escorted into Mr. Kimbrough's office|KIMBROUGH|Nice to meet you, pleasure, thanks for coming in.
Jerry and George are escorted into Mr. Kimbrough's office|GEORGE|Kimbrough.
Jerry and George are escorted into Mr. Kimbrough's office|JERRY|Don't spell.
Jerry and George are escorted into Mr. Kimbrough's office|GEORGE|K-I-M-B-R-O-U-G-H
Jerry and George are escorted into Mr. Kimbrough's office|KIMBROUGH|That's right.
Jerry and George are escorted into Mr. Kimbrough's office|GEORGE|It's a talent I have.
Jerry and George are escorted into Mr. Kimbrough's office|KIMBROUGH|Why don't we sit down, glad you're here.
Jerry and George are escorted into Mr. Kimbrough's office|GEORGE|Woo! Some day out there - You ever see weather like that? Woo! It's crisp - it's crispy crisp.
Jerry and George are escorted into Mr. Kimbrough's office|JERRY|Shut up, George.
Jerry and George are escorted into Mr. Kimbrough's office|KIMBROUGH|Can I get you anything?
Jerry and George are escorted into Mr. Kimbrough's office|GEORGE|What do we have in the fruit department?
Jerry and George are escorted into Mr. Kimbrough's office|JERRY|Oy.
Jerry and George are escorted into Mr. Kimbrough's office|STU|Pineapple.
Jerry and George are escorted into Mr. Kimbrough's office|GEORGE|Oh, that's a dangerous fruit. It's like a weapon that thing, got spikes on the end. You can get killed from one of those things.
Jerry and George are escorted into Mr. Kimbrough's office|KIMBROUGH|Anyway, let me tell you why I called. When I took over here last month, I reviewed what was in development,and it was pretty much same old, same old.
Jerry and George are escorted into Mr. Kimbrough's office|GEORGE|Been there, done that.
Jerry and George are escorted into Mr. Kimbrough's office|KIMBROUGH|Right. I was looking for something different. Something that would have people talking at the water coolers.
Jerry and George are escorted into Mr. Kimbrough's office|GEORGE|Water coolers?
Jerry and George are escorted into Mr. Kimbrough's office|CRESPI|We call it a water-cooler show.
Jerry and George are escorted into Mr. Kimbrough's office|JERRY|Because the next day in the offices, people gather around the water coolers to talk about it, right?
Jerry and George are escorted into Mr. Kimbrough's office|GEORGE|See, I think people would talk about it at the coffee machines.
Jerry and George are escorted into Mr. Kimbrough's office|JERRY|Well it's probably just easier to say "water cooler show" than "coffee machine show."
Jerry and George are escorted into Mr. Kimbrough's office|GEORGE|It's really not accurate. Nobody drinks from a water cooler any more - they use bottles.
Jerry and George are escorted into Mr. Kimbrough's office|JERRY|But I think Mr. Kimbrough makes a good point.
Jerry and George are escorted into Mr. Kimbrough's office|KIMBROUGH|Anyway, Stu here started telling me about a show, "Jerry", that he developed five years ago.
Jerry and George are escorted into Mr. Kimbrough's office|STU|I have always loved it.
Jerry and George are escorted into Mr. Kimbrough's office|KIMBROUGH|He said it was a show about nothing. So, I saw the pilot and I've got to tell you - I flipped out.
Jerry and George are escorted into Mr. Kimbrough's office|CRESPI|He totally flipped out.
Jerry and George are escorted into Mr. Kimbrough's office|KIMBROUGH|What I want to do is put it on the air. 13-episode commitment. Start it off on Wednesday night, build up an audience. This show needs time to grow. I love that Kramer guy.
Jerry and George are escorted into Mr. Kimbrough's office|JERRY|He's a little off the wall.
Jerry and George are escorted into Mr. Kimbrough's office|CRESPI|Oh yeah.
Jerry and George are escorted into Mr. Kimbrough's office|STU|Kramer.
Jerry and George are escorted into Mr. Kimbrough's office|KIMBROUGH|And Elaine - I wouldn't mind seeing something happening between you two.
Jerry and George are escorted into Mr. Kimbrough's office|JERRY|Definitely.
Jerry and George are escorted into Mr. Kimbrough's office|GEORGE|I tell you, I really don't think so-called relationship humor is what this show is all about.
Jerry and George are escorted into Mr. Kimbrough's office|KIMBROUGH|Or we could not do the show altogether, how about that?
Jerry and George are escorted into Mr. Kimbrough's office|GEORGE|Or we could get them together. Woo!
George and Jerry attempt a hug outside Mr. Kimbrough's office|GEORGE|Yeah!
George and Jerry attempt a hug outside Mr. Kimbrough's office|JERRY|Yeah!

Elaine is at home using the phone when Jerry calls to tell her the news|ELAINE|I was on the other line talking to Jill.
Elaine is at home using the phone when Jerry calls to tell her the news|JERRY|Jill? Well, why didn't you say so?
Elaine is at home using the phone when Jerry calls to tell her the news|ELAINE|You said it was an emergency.
Elaine is at home using the phone when Jerry calls to tell her the news|JERRY|So now she's lost a phone face-off? That's even worse than your cell phone walk-and-talk.
Jerry is telling his parents the good news about Jerry|HELEN|Congratulations, they're doing the show.
Jerry is telling his parents the good news about Jerry|MORTY|They should have put that show on 5 years ago. Bunch of idiots at that network. Can I tell you something, Jerry? It's all crap on TV. The only thing I watch is Xena the Warrior Princess. She must be about six-six.

George is telling his parents the news.|GEORGE|He wouldn't put it on if he didn't like it.
George is telling his parents the news.|ESTELLE|Well, what are you doing?
George is telling his parents the news.|GEORGE|I'm writing.
George is telling his parents the news.|ESTELLE|You know how to write?
George is telling his parents the news.|FRANK|Without the writing, you have nothing. You're the ones that make them look good.
George is telling his parents the news.|ESTELLE|Since when do you know how to write? I never saw you write anything.
George is telling his parents the news.|GEORGE|Ma?!
George is telling his parents the news.|ESTELLE|I don't know how you're going to write all those shows. And where are you get all the ideas?
George is telling his parents the news.|FRANK|Would you leave him alone? You'll shatter his confidence!
George is telling his parents the news.|GEORGE|I don't need any ideas. It's a show about nothing.
George is telling his parents the news.|ESTELLE|Nothing. Please. I'll tell you the truth - the whole thing sounds pretty stupid to me.

Jerry's Apartment|KRAMER|Yeah, but Jerry, what happens if the show's a hit? You could be out there for years! You might never come back.
Jerry's Apartment|JERRY|No, I'll be back.
Jerry's Apartment|KRAMER|Jerry. It's L.A. Nobody leaves. She's a seductress, she's a siren, she's a virgin, she's a whore.
Jerry's Apartment|JERRY|And my agent said as a bonus, I can use their private jet, so we'll all go somewhere - the four of us, one big fling before George and I go to California.
Jerry's Apartment|KRAMER|Fling!

Jerry's Apartment|ELAINE|Well, I can't call from the limo. Can I call from the plane?
Jerry's Apartment|JERRY|First you make a cell-phone walk-and-talk, then she loses a call-waiting face-off, now you're talking about a plane call?

Jerry's Apartment|JERRY|Yeah, that's right.
Jerry's Apartment|NEWMAN|Well, I hear it's quite beautiful there this time of year, and of course you know I'm one-quarter French.
Jerry's Apartment|JERRY|Really.
Jerry's Apartment|NEWMAN|Oh yes, in fact I still have family there. This probably won't interest you, but I have a cousin there who's suffering very badly. She's lost all use of her muscles. She can only communicate by blinking. I would so love to see her - bring a ray of sunshine into her tragic life. But alas, I can't afford it, for I am, as you know, but a simple postal worker.
Jerry's Apartment|JERRY|That's a shame.
Jerry's Apartment|NEWMAN|Take me! Take me!
Jerry's Apartment|JERRY|Oh, forget it. Pull yourself together. You're making me sick. Be a man!
Jerry's Apartment|NEWMAN|All right! But hear me and hear me well - The day will come. Oh yes, mark my words, Seinfeld - your day of reckoning is coming. When an evil wind will blow through your little playworld, and wipe that smug smile off your face. And I'll be there, in all my glory, watching - watching as it all comes crumbling down.

In front of a store, in Latham, Massachusetts|ELAINE|What? No, no - we didn't do anything.
In front of a store, in Latham, Massachusetts|OFFICER|That's exactly right. The law requires you to help or assist anyone in danger as long as it's reasonable todo so.

In a cell, at the Latham County Jail|KRAMER|The Samaritans were an ancient tribe - very helpful to people.
In a cell, at the Latham County Jail|ELAINE|Alright - um, excuse me, hi, could you tell me what kind of law this is.
In a cell, at the Latham County Jail|DEPUTY|Well, they just passed it last year. It's modeled after the French law. I heard about it after Princess Diana was killed and all those photographers were just standing around.
In a cell, at the Latham County Jail|JERRY|Oh, yeah.
In a cell, at the Latham County Jail|ELAINE|Oh, yeah.
In a cell, at the Latham County Jail|DEPUTY|You're the first ones to be arrested on it, probably in the whole country.
In a cell, at the Latham County Jail|GEORGE|All right, so what's the penalty here? Let's just pay the fine or something and get the hell out of here.
In a cell, at the Latham County Jail|DEPUTY|Well, it's not that easy. Now see, the law calls for a maximum fine of $85,000 and as much as five years in prison.
In a cell, at the Latham County Jail|ELAINE|What?
In a cell, at the Latham County Jail|GEORGE|Oh no no no no - we have to be in California next week. We're starting a TV show.
In a cell, at the Latham County Jail|DEPUTY|California? Oh gosh, I don't think so. Yeah, my guess is you're gonna be prosecuted. Better get yourselves a good lawyer.

Rivera Live news show|RIVERA|Hi everybody, I'm Geraldo Rivera. Tonight we'll be talking about what most of you have probably been discussing in your homes, and around the water coolers in your offices. I am speaking of course of the controversial Good Samaritan trial that gets underway Thursday in Latham, Massachusetts. Now before we meet our distinguished panel, let's go to Latham live, where Jane Wells is standing by. Jane-
Rivera Live news show|WELLS|Yes. Good evening, Geraldo.
Rivera Live news show|RIVERA|What's the mood? What's going on tonight?
Rivera Live news show|WELLS|Well, Latham is fairly quite tonight, considering the media circus that has descended upon this quaint little town.
Rivera Live news show|RIVERA|And what about the defendants - the so-called New York Four. How are they holding up?
Rivera Live news show|WELLS|Well, I did speak with one of the deputies who had some contact with them, and he told me quote "There's no love lost with that group."
Rivera Live news show|RIVERA|Anything else, Jane?
Rivera Live news show|WELLS|There also seems to be some friction between Mr. Seinfeld, and Ms. Benes. The rumor is that they once dated, and it's possible that ended badly.
Rivera Live news show|RIVERA|Well, ladies and gentlemen, who know, maybe this trial will bring them closer together. Maybe they'll even end up getting married.

Court is starting|VANDELAY|Mr. Hoyt.
Court is starting|HOYT|Ladies and gentlemen, last year, our City Council by a vote of twelve to two, passed a Good Samaritan Law. Now, essentially, we made it a crime to ignore a fellow human being in trouble. Now this group from New York not only ignored, but, as we will prove, they actually mocked the victim as he was being robbed at gunpoint. I can guarantee you one other thing, ladies and gentlemen, this is not the first time they have behaved in this manner. On the contrary, they have quite a record of mocking and maligning. This is a history of selfishness, self-absorption, immaturity, and greed. And you will see how everyone who has come into contact with these four individuals has been abused, wronged, deceived and betrayed. This time, they have gone too far. This time they are going to be held accountable. This time, they are the ones who will pay.

Court is starting|CHILES|I am shocked and chagrined, mortified and stupefied. This trial is outrageous! It is a waste of the taxpayers' time and money. It is a travesty of justice that these four people have been incarcerated while the real perpetrator is walking around laughing - lying and laughing, laughing and lying. You know what these four people were? They were innocentbystanders. Now, you just think about that term. Innocent. Bystanders. Because that's exactly what they were. We know theywere bystanders, nobody's disputing that. So how can a bystander be guilty? No such thing. Have you ever heard of a guilty bystander? No, because you cannot be a bystander and be guilty. Bystanders are by definition, innocent. That is the nature of bystanding. But no, they want to change nature here. They want to create a whole new animal - the guilty bystander. Don't you let them do it. Only you can stop them.

Rivera Live|RIVERA|Hi everybody, I'm Geraldo Rivera and welcome to this special edition of Rivera Live. Well, arguments in the Good Samaritan trial ended today. The jury has been in deliberation for four and a half hours now. Let's go live to Jane Wells who is in Latham, Massachusetts, covering this trial for us. Jane -
Rivera Live|WELLS|Geraldo, just a few minutes ago, the jury asked to see the video tape.
Rivera Live|RIVERA|That's the one where they are overheard making sarcastic remarks during the robbery.
Rivera Live|WELLS|Yes, it's a very incriminating piece of evidence. But I must tell you, Geraldo, this courtroom and everyone who has attended this trial is still reeling from the endless parade of witness who have come forth so enthusiastically to testify against these four seemingly ordinary people. One even had the feeling that if Judge Vandelay didn't finally put a stop to it, it could've gone on for months.
Rivera Live|RIVERA|Jane, whose testimony do you think resonated most strongly with this jury?
Rivera Live|WELLS|That is so hard to say. Certainly there's the doctor with the poison invitations. The Bubble Boy was an extremely sympathetic and tragic figure. And that bizarre contest certainly didn't sit well with this small town jury.There's the woman they sold the defective wheelchair to, the deported Pakistani restaurateur. Geraldo, it just went on, and on, and on, into the night.
Rivera Live|RIVERA|And so we wait.
The group, waiting for the jury to decide|JERRY|Do they make you wear uniforms in prison?
The group, waiting for the jury to decide|ELAINE|I think so.
The group, waiting for the jury to decide|JERRY|It's not that bright orange one is it?
The group, waiting for the jury to decide|ELAINE|I hope it's not that one, because I cannot wear orange.
The group, waiting for the jury to decide|KRAMER|Will you stop worrying? Jackie's going to get us off. He never loses. How about when he asked that cop if a black man had ever been to his house. Did you see the look on his face?
George's mother, Estelle, tries to butter up Judge Vandelay|ESTELLE|Sorry to bother you, Judge.
George's mother, Estelle, tries to butter up Judge Vandelay|VANDELAY|How did you get in here?
George's mother, Estelle, tries to butter up Judge Vandelay|ESTELLE|Please, if he's found guilty, please be kind to him. He's a good boy.
George's mother, Estelle, tries to butter up Judge Vandelay|VANDELAY|This is highly irregular.
George's mother, Estelle, tries to butter up Judge Vandelay|ESTELLE|Well, maybe there's something I can do for you.
George's mother, Estelle, tries to butter up Judge Vandelay|VANDELAY|What do you mean?
George's mother, Estelle, tries to butter up Judge Vandelay|ESTELLE|You know

Back in the courtroom|FOREMAN|We have, Your Honor.
Back in the courtroom|VANDELAY|Will the defendants please rise. And how do you find, with respect to the charge of criminal indifference?
Back in the courtroom|FOREMAN|We find the defendants - guilty.
Back in the courtroom|VANDELAY|Order! Order in this court, I will clear this room! I do not know how, or under what circumstances the four of you found each other, but your callous indifference and utter disregard for everything that is good and decent has rocked the very foundation upon which our society is built. I can think of nothing more fitting than for the four of youto spend a year removed from society so that you can contemplate the manner in which you have conducted yourselves. I know I will. This court is adjourned.
Back in the courtroom|action|Exit Judge Vandelay
Back in the courtroom|GEORGE|You had to hop! You had to hop on the plane.

The group, walking back to the holding cell|KRAMER|Could be fun. Don't have to worry about your meals, or what you're going to do Saturday night. And they do shows. Yeah, we could put on a show - maybe "Bye Bye Birdie" or "My Fair Lady". Elaine, you could be Liza Doolittle.

The group, walking back to the holding cell|JERRY|Sure.
The group, walking back to the holding cell|ELAINE|Cause you only get one call. The prison call is like the king of calls.
The group, walking back to the holding cell|JERRY|I think that would be a very nice gesture.
The group, walking back to the holding cell|KRAMER|I got it - it's out! How about that, huh? Oh, boy, what a relief.
The group, walking back to the holding cell|JERRY|See now, to me, that button is in the worst possible spot.
The group, walking back to the holding cell|GEORGE|Really?
The group, walking back to the holding cell|JERRY|Oh yeah. The second button is the key button. It literally makes or breaks the shirt. Look at it, it's too high, it's in no-man's land.
The group, walking back to the holding cell|GEORGE|Haven't we had this conversation before?
The group, walking back to the holding cell|JERRY|You think?
The group, walking back to the holding cell|GEORGE|I think we have.
The group, walking back to the holding cell|JERRY|Yeah, maybe we have.
Epilogue, on stage in the prison|JERRY|So what is the deal with the yard? I mean when I was a kid my mother wanted me to play in the yard. But of course she didn't have to worry about my next door neighbor Tommy sticking a shiv in my thigh. And what's with the lockdown? Why do we have to be locked in our cells? Are we that bad that we have to be sent to prison, in prison? You would think the weightlifting and the sodomy is enough. So, anyone from Cellblock D?
