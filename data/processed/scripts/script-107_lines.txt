Opening Scene: Jerry and Elaine are outside, heading towards the apartment building|ELAINE|Well, I guess he figured you just wouldn't care. It *has* been a few years.
Opening Scene: Jerry and Elaine are outside, heading towards the apartment building|JERRY|Elaine, you always care who an ex-girlfriend dates. You don't want it to be someone you know, and you don't want it to be someone better than you. Now, even though the latter is *obviously* impossible.
Opening Scene: Jerry and Elaine are outside, heading towards the apartment building|ELAINE|Oh, god.
Opening Scene: Jerry and Elaine are outside, heading towards the apartment building|JERRY|The former still applies. I don't know what it is, but I just can't see you with a mechanic.
Opening Scene: Jerry and Elaine are outside, heading towards the apartment building|ELAINE|Oh, yeah. Right, right. Well, all those mechanics do is work all day with their hands and their *big*, *muscular* arms on machines, and then they come home dripping with animal sexuality like Stanley Kowalski. What a huge turn-off that is.
Opening Scene: Jerry and Elaine are outside, heading towards the apartment building|JERRY|All right.

Later, Jerry and George are outside, where Jerry has just bought a candy bar at the newsstand|JERRY|It's not even a question of that. The point is when something like this is passed along, one must be certain that it's going to be used in a *conscientious* way. This is not some parlor trick to be used---
Later, Jerry and George are outside, where Jerry has just bought a candy bar at the newsstand|GEORGE|You're gonna tell me...or not.

I'm comfortable with the swirl. *I* feel the swirl is a great capper. He uses the pinch, which I find a little presumptuous.
Back at Jerry's apartment: Jerry and George have just walked in, still conversing on the same subject|GEORGE|Is it a clockwise swirl?
Back at Jerry's apartment: Jerry and George have just walked in, still conversing on the same subject|JERRY|I prefer clockwise, but it's not written in stone.

Back at Jerry's apartment: Jerry and George have just walked in, still conversing on the same subject|KRAMER|Have you ever *met* a proctologist? Well, they usually have a very good sense of humor. You meet a proctologist at a party, don't walk away. *Plant* yourself there, because you will hear the funniest stories you've ever heard. See, no one wants to admit to them that they *stuck* something up there. Never! It's always an accident. Every proctologist story ends in the same way: "It was a million to one shot, Doc. Million to one."
