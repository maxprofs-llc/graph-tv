Jerry's Apartment|JERRY|(zipping up his bag) Sometimes you do.
Jerry's Apartment|GEORGE|Maybe it's some small thing I could change. Like a moustache. Or wearing a top hat, or a monocle, or a..or a cane.
Jerry's Apartment|JERRY|(picking up his bag and coat) Who's she dating? Mr Peanut?

Monk's|DANIELLE|You look like you're in better shape than Neil. Do you work out?
Monk's|GEORGE|(smiling) Listen, I..I..I don't mean to seem forward...

Monk's|GEORGE|...but is there any way that I could possibly have Neil's phone number?
Monk's|action|Now it's Danielle's time to look surprised and bewildered.
Outside Movie Theatre|action|Elaine and Blaine emerge from the exit, having seen The English Patient.

Recreation Center, Del Boca Vista|action|Izzy picks up a set of weights and lifts them chest high.
Recreation Center, Del Boca Vista|MORTY|See that? You couldn't do that.
Recreation Center, Del Boca Vista|JERRY|I could, but I choose not to.

Recreation Center, Del Boca Vista|JERRY|(smiles) Actually, I am a comedian.
Recreation Center, Del Boca Vista|SID|That's not so funny.
Recreation Center, Del Boca Vista|IZZY|(challenging) Think you're better than me, huh?
Recreation Center, Del Boca Vista|MORTY|Izzy used to work out with Charles Atlas in the fifties.
Recreation Center, Del Boca Vista|JERRY|(jocular) Eighteen-fifties?
Recreation Center, Del Boca Vista|IZZY|Yeah, that's it. It's go time. (points to the weights he put down) Let's see you lift that.
Recreation Center, Del Boca Vista|JERRY|(reluctant) Mr Mandelbaum, I...

Recreation Center, Del Boca Vista|JERRY|(consenting) Alright.
Recreation Center, Del Boca Vista|IZZY|Yeah, wrong attitude. you're not bringing that trash into my house.

Recreation Center, Del Boca Vista|IZZY|I'll show you. We're gonna take it up a notch.
Recreation Center, Del Boca Vista|action|Izzy bends and takes hold of the bar. The second he puts any effort into the lift, there is a loud crunching noise and a pained look of horror comes to his face.
Recreation Center, Del Boca Vista|IZZY|(agonised) Ah! My back. Ugh.
Recreation Center, Del Boca Vista|action|Izzy keeps hold of the bar as he slowly keels over forwards. The circular weights roll in front of him and Izzy gently falls forward until he's face down on the floor.
Recreation Center, Del Boca Vista|IZZY|(drawn out) Aaaahh.
Recreation Center, Del Boca Vista|action|Jerry, Morty and Sid, look on, concerned.
Recreation Center, Del Boca Vista|SID|Somebody, call an ambulance.

Outside Movie Theatre|ELAINE|It's just a stupid movie.
Outside Movie Theatre|BLAINE|(to Carol) That's what I'm talking about.
Outside Movie Theatre|CAROL|(taking Blaine's arm) Come on, Blaine. Let's go.

Seinfeld Residence, Del Boca Vista|JERRY|(defensive) He egged me on.
Seinfeld Residence, Del Boca Vista|HELEN|You should be more mature.

Jerry's Apartment/Del Boca Vista|KRAMER|Yes I am.
Jerry's Apartment/Del Boca Vista|JERRY|What colour is it?
Jerry's Apartment/Del Boca Vista|action|Kramer looks down at his bare torso, and can't think.

Earl Haffler's Office|KRAMER|(nervous) Okay, well, uh, I'll uh, I'll get the Cubans.
Earl Haffler's Office|action|Kramer walks over to the door trying to smile confidently.
Earl Haffler's Office|KRAMER|They're right out here.
Earl Haffler's Office|action|Kramer calls a few words of nonsense Spanish out of the door, and the three guys stroll in. They are dressed in Castro-style green fatigues and caps.
Earl Haffler's Office|KRAMER|Hey, here they are. The Cubans. Real Cubans.
Earl Haffler's Office|action|Earl Haffler regards the three for a second or two.
Earl Haffler's Office|HAFFLER|You wouldn't be trying to sell old Earl Haffler Dominicans in a Cuban wrapper now, would you?
Earl Haffler's Office|KRAMER|(fidgety) Oh, now, come on. Look at these boys. If they were any more Cuban, Castro would've smoked them himself. Huh.
Earl Haffler's Office|HAFFLER|(confusion) We're talking about people, right?
Earl Haffler's Office|KRAMER|(puzzled) I think so.
Earl Haffler's Office|HAFFLER|I thought he quit smoking cigars.
Earl Haffler's Office|KRAMER|Well, yeah, yeah. But they also rolled for his brother... (thinks for a second) ...Dennis.
Earl Haffler's Office|HAFFLER|(dubious) Dennis Castro?
Earl Haffler's Office|KRAMER|Uh, Dwayne.
Earl Haffler's Office|HAFFLER|Get the hell outta my office.
Earl Haffler's Office|KRAMER|(shrill) What!?
Monk's|action|Danielle and George walk over to, and sit in, a booth.
Monk's|DANIELLE|You know, Neil called me today.
Monk's|GEORGE|(interested) Really?
Monk's|DANIELLE|Yeah. He's pretty upset that I broke up with him to go out with you.
Monk's|GEORGE|(smug) Ah, I guess I showed Neil who's Neil.
Monk's|DANIELLE|He wants to get together tomorrow night and have coffee.
Monk's|GEORGE|(little worried) Coffee? (thinks) I can beat that. Move in with me.
Monk's|DANIELLE|(surprised) What?
Monk's|GEORGE|(smiles) Beats the hell out of coffee.
Monk's|action|Danielle smiles at George, still a touch confused.
Movie Theatre|action|Peterman and Elaine sit in the auditorium. The English Patient is playing and many of the crowd are tearfully dabbing their eyes. Peterman is particularly emotional. Elaine looks completely bored, and is tossing pieces of popcorn up in the air to try and catch them in her mouth.
Movie Theatre|PETERMAN|(emotional) And I thought I knew what love was.
Movie Theatre|action|One of Elaine's bits of popcorn misses her mouth and falls behind her seat. Elaine twists round and reaches over to retrieve it, before slumping in her seat wearily.
Movie Theatre|ELAINE|(indifferent) Yuh.
Monk's|action|Jerry and George sit in a booth. George looks ragged and is swigging from a bottle of some anti-acid medication.
Monk's|JERRY|(incredulous) You asked her to move in with you?
Monk's|GEORGE|I gotta stay one step ahead of Neil.
Monk's|JERRY|(musing) What if it's Neil Armstrong?
Monk's|action|George thinks for a moment, his eyes twitching.
Monk's|GEORGE|(animated) Then I'm going to Mars!
Monk's|JERRY|What if it's Neil Diamond?
Monk's|GEORGE|(tormented) Aw, shut up Jerry! Just shut up!
Monk's|JERRY|Alright, I gotta go back to the hospital.
Monk's|GEORGE|What, to see the old guy?
Monk's|JERRY|No, I got into a thing with the son, and now he's laid up too.
Monk's|GEORGE|How old's the son?
Monk's|JERRY|I think he's the same age as the father.
Monk's|GEORGE|What is with this family?
Monk's|JERRY|I dunno. It's like, if one of 'em dies, the other one wants to bench press the casket.
Monk's|action|Kramer sidles into the coffee shop. He peers past the register, to where the three guys are sitting in the far corner, talking together. Then he moves over to join Jerry and George.
Monk's|KRAMER|(quietly) Hey, Jerry.
Monk's|action|Kramer indicates the three guys with his thumb.
Monk's|KRAMER|(noise - like shivery) Datiditadit.
Monk's|JERRY|You're cold?
Monk's|KRAMER|No. (indicates with his head) (noise again) Ditadidatidat.
Monk's|JERRY|Something wrong with your chest?
Monk's|KRAMER|(indicating with his thumb) Dijadidatjd. There.
Monk's|JERRY|(leaning round Kramer) Where?
Monk's|KRAMER|(urgent) No, no. Don't look. Don't look.
Monk's|action|Jerry and George look as if they're infected by Kramer's nervousness, as they try and look surreptitiously at the Dominicans.
Monk's|KRAMER|Over there. The Dominicans.
Monk's|JERRY|Aren't they supposed to be rolling cigars?
Monk's|KRAMER|Well, it didn't quite work out, and now I've got nothing for them to do.
Monk's|GEORGE|So?
Monk's|KRAMER|So, I taught 'em all about Cuba, and they really took to it. You know, Marxism, the Worker's Revolution, the clothing.
Monk's|action|In the corner, one of the Dominicans thumps the table, as if to underscore a point in his argument.
Monk's|JERRY|Boy, they seem pretty angry about something.
Monk's|KRAMER|(nervous) Yeah. I'm a little worried. When there's no work, and the people get restless, who do you think they come after? (pointing to himself, shrill) El Presidente!
Monk's|action|Again, one of the Dominicans thumps the table. Kramer jumps at the sound.
The New York Hospital|action|Izzy and Izzy Jr are laid up in beds placed side-by-side.
The New York Hospital|JERRY|I swear to you, I didn't know they TV was bolted to the table.
The New York Hospital|JERRY|He couldn't handle the weight.
The New York Hospital|IZZY|(hostile) Oh, so now you think you're better than me?
The New York Hospital|JERRY|(placatory) Look, let me just state for the record, I think you're both better than me.
The New York Hospital|IZZY|Okay.
The New York Hospital|action|An even more elderly guy than Izzy enters the room behind Jerry. He spreads his arms in greeting to the Mandelbaums.
The New York Hospital|IZZY|My dad.
The New York Hospital|JERRY|(incredulous) Oh, come on!
The New York Hospital|JERRY|He was trying to lift the TV.
The New York Hospital|action|Izzy Sr. strides purposefully toward the TV.
The New York Hospital|JERRY|(consternation) Oh no. (to the bedridden two) It's go time.
The New York Hospital|action|Off-screen there is a familiar crunching sound.
The New York Hospital|action|All three of the Mandelbaums are in a row of beds in the same room.
The New York Hospital|IZZY|I still thought you could do it.
The New York Hospital|JERRY|Fellas, fellas, look, I gotta go.
The New York Hospital|IZZY|Oh yeah, that's right. Go. Put us all in the hospital. And you've ruined our business with all your macho head games.
The New York Hospital|JERRY|(defensive) I didn't ruin your business.
The New York Hospital|IZZY|Yes, you did. There's nobody there now at the Magic Pan to roll the crepes. We gotta close it up.
The New York Hospital|JERRY|(uncertain) Don't you hire people to do that?
The New York Hospital|IZZY|Each crepe has to be hand-rolled by a Mandelbaum. That's what puts the magic in Magic Pan!
The New York Hospital|JERRY|(thinking) So, you just need some guys that could roll 'em?
The New York Hospital|IZZY|Yeah.
The New York Hospital|JERRY|(having an idea) I think I can help you out. I'll see you later.
The New York Hospital|action|Jerry turns and starts to leave, but is called back.
The New York Hospital|action|Jerry walks to the TV and picks it,and the attached cabinet up. HE carries it across the room to the foot of Izzy Sr.'s bed,where he places it.
The New York Hospital|JERRY|Here.
The New York Hospital|action|Jerry walks out of the room followed by the angry cries of Izzy.
The New York Hospital|IZZY|You think you're better than us, don't you?! Huh!?
Movie Theatre|action|Peterman and Elaine are still in front of The English Patient. Peterman stares, enraptured, at the screen. Elaine is totally frantic with boredom.
Movie Theatre|PETERMAN|Elaine, I hope you're watching the clothes, because I can't take my eyes off the passion.
Movie Theatre|ELAINE|(quiet vehemence) Oh. No. I can't do this any more. I can't. It's too long. (to the screen) Quit telling your stupid story, about the stupid desert, and just die already! (louder) Die!!
Movie Theatre|action|The other movie patrons turn and shush Elaine, who sits back in her seat.
Movie Theatre|PETERMAN|(surprised) Elaine. You don't like the movie?
Movie Theatre|ELAINE|(shouts) I hate it!!
Movie Theatre|CROWD|Shh!
Movie Theatre|ELAINE|(shouts) Oh, go to hell!!
Movie Theatre|PETERMAN|(quietly) Well, why didn't you say so in the first place? You're fired.
Movie Theatre|ELAINE|(grabbing her bag and coat) Great. I'll wait for you outside.
Movie Theatre|action|Elaine hurriedly gets out of her seat and leaves.
Magic Pan Restaurant|action|Jerry and Elaine sit in a booth, talking over coffee.
Magic Pan Restaurant|JERRY|He was gonna fire you?
Magic Pan Restaurant|ELAINE|The only way I could talk him out of it was that I agreed to go and visit the Tunisian desert.
Magic Pan Restaurant|JERRY|Tunisia?
Magic Pan Restaurant|ELAINE|That's where they filmed the movie. It's supposed to inspire me.
Magic Pan Restaurant|JERRY|Well, that doesn't sound so bad.
Magic Pan Restaurant|ELAINE|I have to live in a cave.
Magic Pan Restaurant|JERRY|(sardonic) Oh. (smiles)
Magic Pan Restaurant|action|Kramer comes over to the booth.
Magic Pan Restaurant|KRAMER|These Dominicans really know their way round a crepe. Look at that. It's like they're rolling a double corona.
Magic Pan Restaurant|action|The three Dominican guys are making crepes, and then rolling them around fillings.
Magic Pan Restaurant|KRAMER|(to one of the guys) Just a cigar made outta bisquik, huh, Guillermo?
Magic Pan Restaurant|action|The Dominican smiles back.
Magic Pan Restaurant|action|Over in another part of the restaurant, Danielle sits in a booth with Neil. Neil is clearly bald, but has his back to the camera.
Magic Pan Restaurant|DANIELLE|I'm very happy with George. I'm sorry Neil, it's over.
Magic Pan Restaurant|action|Neil's head drops at this news.
Magic Pan Restaurant|DANIELLE|Come on, let's just eat our crepes.
Magic Pan Restaurant|action|The Dominicans are handing out plates of rolled crepes to various tables.
Magic Pan Restaurant|action|At one table a customer prods a rolled crepe with his fork and a jet of scalding hot filling squirts out into his face.
Magic Pan Restaurant|CUSTOMER|(pained scream) Aaghh!! My face!
Magic Pan Restaurant|action|At another table, another customer digs his fork in, and is rewarded with a faceful of blistering filling.
Magic Pan Restaurant|action|Neil sticks his fork into his crepe and recoils as hot liquid jets into his face.
Magic Pan Restaurant|DANIELLE|(concerned cry) Neil!
Magic Pan Restaurant|action|The restaurant is in chaos as yells of pain come from all sides. Elaine, Jerry and Kramer look round at the commotion.
Magic Pan Restaurant|JERRY|Why are the crepes spraying?
Magic Pan Restaurant|KRAMER|(looks over at the three guys) The Dominicans are rolling them too tight. (regretful) Uhm, well, that's why you gotta get real Cubans.
Magic Pan Restaurant|action|Another scream rents the air.
Metropolitan Hospital Center|action|In a hospital room, Neil lies in a bed, his face obscured with bandages and an IV line connected to him. Danielle is there fussing with the remains of a hospital meal on a tray. George enters.
Metropolitan Hospital Center|GEORGE|Danielle. Where's Neil? (indicating the bed) Is this him?
Metropolitan Hospital Center|DANIELLE|Yeah, that blueberry crepe burned him pretty badly.
Metropolitan Hospital Center|action|George picks up a walking stick which was propped against the bed.
Metropolitan Hospital Center|GEORGE|(to Danielle) Whose cane is this?
Metropolitan Hospital Center|DANIELLE|It's Neil's.
Metropolitan Hospital Center|action|Danielle walks away with a water jug from Neil's table. She goes to a sink in the corner as George speaks.
Metropolitan Hospital Center|GEORGE|(to himself) A cane. I knew it. (to Neil) So, we meet at last. I admire your skills, Mr Peanut.
Metropolitan Hospital Center|action|Danielle brings back the jug.
Metropolitan Hospital Center|GEORGE|Well, Danielle, (digs in his pocket) we should get going. I got a key made for you.
Metropolitan Hospital Center|action|George flourishes a doorkey before Danielle.
Metropolitan Hospital Center|DANIELLE|George, I can't move in with you.
Metropolitan Hospital Center|GEORGE|(shocked) What?
Metropolitan Hospital Center|DANIELLE|I'm sorry, but I'm taking Neil to a clinic in England.
Metropolitan Hospital Center|GEORGE|(animated) N..no, no. You can't leave me. (frantic) Marry me! I'll burn myself. I'll burn my parents!
Metropolitan Hospital Center|DANIELLE|Sorry George.
Metropolitan Hospital Center|action|Danielle takes the jug and leaves the room. Dejectedly, George wanders toward the door. As he moves, Neil whispers to him.
Metropolitan Hospital Center|NEIL|(beckoning) George.
Metropolitan Hospital Center|action|George leans over to Neil, so he can hear him speak.
Metropolitan Hospital Center|NEIL|(quiet triumph) I win.
Metropolitan Hospital Center|action|George purses his lips and nods ruefully. He stands up and leaves, closing the door behind him. There is a brief pause, then the door opens a few inches and George's hand reaches back inside the room, takes hold of the IV line and tugs it sharply, breaking it free of the IV bag,and drops it. Then the hand is withdrawn and the door closes again.
Plane|action|Elaine sits in an aisle seat in a 747, reading a Let's Go Tunisia book. She listens as a voice comes over the tannoy.
Plane|TAN|Ladies and gentlemen. In just one moment, we'll be showing our feature presentation...
Plane|ELAINE|(dread) No, no, no, no, no.
Plane|TAN|...the comedy hit, Sack Lunch, starring Dabney Coleman.
Plane|ELAINE|(cheering up) Ah, right! Aw, this is shaping up.
Plane|action|Smiling, Elaine puts down her book to watch the movie. Someone from a seat beside her wants to get out.
Plane|GUY|Excuse me, please.
Plane|ELAINE|Oh, sure.
Plane|action|The guy pushes past her. He's holding a rolled-up magazine closely to his body, as if concealing something and, strangely, is wearing a '#1 DAD' t-shirt. There's a little awkwardness as he squeezes by.
Plane|ELAINE|(uncomfortable) Ooh.
Plane|action|The guy walks down the aisle and turns to face the passengers. Two other guys in '#1 DAD' t-shirts flank him. They are the three Dominican guys.
Plane|GUILLERMO|Ladies and gentlemen. Because we have been exploited by your Magic Pan crepe restaurants...
Plane|action|From inside his magazine, Guillermo produces a revolver. The other two guys also pull out guns, which they point upwards and cock, loudly.
Plane|GUILLERMO|...we are hijacking this plane to Cuba!
Plane|action|There is consternation among the passengers, shocked looks, gasps, etc.
Plane|GUILLERMO|Everyone stay in your seats. And shut that movie off!
Plane|ELAINE|(annoyed) Aww, nuts!
