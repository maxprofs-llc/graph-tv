Jerry's Apartment|action|Elaine is touching up her make-up at the table
Jerry's Apartment|ELAINE|Hey, do you believe I got Happy New Yeared today? It's February.
Jerry's Apartment|JERRY|I once got Happy New Yeared in March.
Jerry's Apartment|ELAINE|It's disgusting.
Jerry's Apartment|JERRY|It's pathetic. . . . hey, is it cold out?
Jerry's Apartment|ELAINE|Really cold.
Jerry's Apartment|JERRY|Scary cold.
Jerry's Apartment|ELAINE|I don't know. What's your definition of scary cold?
Jerry's Apartment|action|George enters in Gore-Tex jacket -- it’s huge/all puffed out
Jerry's Apartment|JERRY|That. (pointing at George)
Jerry's Apartment|ELAINE|(Laughing as she says it) What is that, ha?
Jerry's Apartment|GEORGE|What?
Jerry's Apartment|JERRY|When did you get that?
Jerry's Apartment|GEORGE|This week. My father got a deal from a friend of his. It's Gore-Tex. You know about Gore-Tex?
Jerry's Apartment|JERRY|You like saying Gore-Tex, don't you?
Jerry's Apartment|action|George turns and closes the apartment door
Jerry's Apartment|ELAINE|Hey, you can't even turn around in that thing.
Jerry's Apartment|JERRY|Look at this
Jerry's Apartment|action|They both start hitting George’s jacket a lot
Jerry's Apartment|ELAINE|Hey George, can you feel this? Can you ...
Jerry's Apartment|action|George stands there, looking at them as they continue hitting his jacket
Jerry's Apartment|GEORGE|All right, all right. KNOCK IT OFF. Come on, let's go.
Jerry's Apartment|ELAINE|Oh listen we should stop off on the way and get a bottle of wine or something.
Jerry's Apartment|JERRY|Yeah. (pointing at Elaine as he goes into the bedroom)
Jerry's Apartment|GEORGE|What for?
Jerry's Apartment|ELAINE|These people invited us for dinner. We have to bring something.
Jerry's Apartment|GEORGE|Why?
Jerry's Apartment|ELAINE|Because it's rude, otherwise.
Jerry's Apartment|GEORGE|You mean just going there because I'm invited, that's rude?
Jerry's Apartment|ELAINE|Yes.
Jerry's Apartment|GEORGE|So you're telling me instead of them being happy to see me, they're going to be upset because I didn't bring anything. Ttst --You see what I'm saying?
Jerry's Apartment|JERRY|The fabric of society is very complex George.
Jerry's Apartment|GEORGE|I don't even drink wine. I drink Pepsi.
Jerry's Apartment|ELAINE|Ya can't bring Pepsi. (Elaine starts putting on her coat and gloves)
Jerry's Apartment|GEORGE|Why not?
Jerry's Apartment|ELAINE|Because we're adults?
Jerry's Apartment|GEORGE|You telling me that wine is better than Pepsi? Huh (snort), no way wine is better than Pepsi.
Jerry's Apartment|JERRY|I tell you George, I don't think we want to walk in there and put a big plastic jug of Pepsi in the middle of the table.
Jerry's Apartment|GEORGE|I just don't like the idea that any time there’s a dinner invitation there's this annoying little chore that goes along with it.
Jerry's Apartment|JERRY|You know, you're getting to be an annoying little chore yourself.
Jerry's Apartment|action|Kramer enters
Jerry's Apartment|KRAMER|All right, let's go. Who's driving? (claps his hands and rubs them together)
Jerry's Apartment|JERRY|You are. I can't get that thing in my car. (referring to George)
Jerry's Apartment|KRAMER|Uh huh.
In Kramer's car|JERRY|Where's the heat in this car? Come on Elaine warm me up, oh! I'm cold. Just give me a little squeeze.
In Kramer's car|ELAINE|Jerry get off of me. Get off of ME! Get off, Get off of Me!
In Kramer's car|GEORGE|Hehehehehe (higher tone laugh, though still quietly )
In Kramer's car|JERRY|You're pretty comfortable up there eh, Bubble boy?
In Kramer's car|GEORGE|Oh, yeah. You wish you had this coat.
In Kramer's car|ELAINE|You know, I was just thinking. The four of us can't show up with just one bottle of wine.
In Kramer's car|GEORGE|Oh, here we go...
In Kramer's car|ELAINE|What?
In Kramer's car|GEORGE|Why don't we get them a couch? (Kramer laughs) We’ll rent a U-haul -- we’ll bring ‘em a nice sectional.
In Kramer's car|KRAMER|(low tone)Yeahhehehehe
In Kramer's car|ELAINE|We should bring some cake. Will you stop off at the bakery?
In Kramer's car|KRAMER|(low tone) All right, yeah.
In Kramer's car|GEORGE|Why don't you just get some Ring Dings from the liquor store?
In Kramer's car|ELAINE|Ring Dings?
In Kramer's car|GEORGE|Hey, Ring Dings are better than anything you're gonna get at a bakery.
In Kramer's car|KRAMER|Ooooh I like Ring Dings.
In Kramer's car|ELAINE|George, we can't show up at someone's house with Ring Dings and Pepsi.
In Kramer's car|KRAMER|HEY YOUR LIGHTS ARE ON! (shouting out the window)
In Kramer's car|GEORGE|(to Kramer) It's a funeral procession. . . . (to Elaine) And I got news for you. I show up with Ring Dings and Pepsi, I become the biggest hit of the party. People be coming up to me, "just between you and me I'm really excited about the Ring Dings and the Pepsi. What are we, Europeans with the Beaujolais and Chardonnay . . .
In Kramer's car|ELAINE|Oh, Kramer, that’s the bakery. Stop here. Stop here.
In Kramer's car|KRAMER|(low tone) All right.

In Kramer's car|KRAMER|All right
The Royal Bakery|ELAINE|Ummm, I love the smell of bakeries.
The Royal Bakery|JERRY|Mmm. Oh look Elaine, the black and white cookie.
The Royal Bakery|ELAINE|Mmm.
The Royal Bakery|JERRY|I love the black and white. Two races of flavor living side by side in harmony. It's a wonderful thing isn't it?
The Royal Bakery|ELAINE|You know I often wonder what you'll be like when you're senile.
The Royal Bakery|JERRY|I'm looking forward to it.
The Royal Bakery|ELAINE|Yeah. I think it will be a very smooth transition for you.
The Royal Bakery|JERRY|Thank you. All right, look at all this stuff. What are we getting'?
The Royal Bakery|ELAINE|CHOCOLATE BABKA! That's their specialty.
The Royal Bakery|JERRY|Love that babka.
The Royal Bakery|ELAINE|Yeah, yeah!
The Royal Bakery|JERRY|So listen Elaine, when we get up to the door, you , you hold the cake box.
The Royal Bakery|ELAINE|Why?
The Royal Bakery|JERRY|I don't know, just standing there with a box, holding it by the little string.
The Royal Bakery|action|holding an imaginary box by the string - pinky finger extended
The Royal Bakery|ELAINE|You think it's effeminate?
The Royal Bakery|JERRY|It's a tad dainty.
The Royal Bakery|ELAINE|Oh, we forgot to pick a number.
The Royal Bakery|JERRY|Oh, see that's not fair. We-We were here ahead of all these people.
The Royal Bakery|ELAINE|I-cu-di-ge--You think I should go and ask her for hers?
The Royal Bakery|JERRY|Ah, no, forget it.
The Royal Bakery|ELAINE|No, no no no, no it's not fair. Just because they have a ticket doesn't mean they were here first. We were here, and we were ahead of them, and them, and her. Come on let's just go ask ‘em. Come on. . . . Excuse me.
Kramer's car|KRAMER|(exhales) Well, I'm not finding a spot here. What do you want to do?
Kramer's car|GEORGE|Ah, Just double park.
Kramer's car|KRAMER|No, no.
Kramer's car|GEORGE|Why not?
Kramer's car|KRAMER|I'll get a ticket! Besides, what if somebody wants to get out of here?
Kramer's car|GEORGE|Are you kidding? People get spaces this good, they never give ‘em up.
Kramer's car|KRAMER|That's a fallacy.
Kramer's car|GEORGE|All right, I'll tell you what... why don't you go into the store and I'll wait in the car?
Kramer's car|KRAMER|Why don't YOU go into the store and I'LL wait in the car?
Kramer's car|GEORGE|Because, I've got the coat. I can sit in the car and not get cold.
Kramer's car|KRAMER|So what I'm going to leave the car running and the heat 'll be on.
Kramer's car|GEORGE|Does the heater even work in this car?
Kramer's car|KRAMER|No.
Kramer's car|GEORGE|Oh, Hey, eh, there's a spot right in front of the liquor store. You see
Kramer's car|KRAMER|I see.
Kramer's car|GEORGE|You see, hu, ho ho.
Royal Bakery|ELAINE|But we were here ahead of you.
Royal Bakery|BARBARA|How do I know that?
Royal Bakery|JERRY|Well we saw you come in.
Royal Bakery|DAVID|Well, that's easy for you to say.
Royal Bakery|ELAINE|Oh, yeah, right, that's something I do all the time, right. I make up stories to get ahead in lines at bakeries.
Royal Bakery|CLERK|46?
Royal Bakery|ELAINE|Wait, wait a second are, are you Barbara Benedict?
Royal Bakery|BARBARA|Yes.
Royal Bakery|ELAINE|Oh my god. I, I know you. I-I’m, I'm Elaine Benes. Do you remember we met at Linda van Grak's baby shower.

Royal Bakery|ELAINE|Well, this is a little awkward, isn't it?
Royal Bakery|BARBARA|Yes it is.
Royal Bakery|ELAINE|You know we were here, ahead of you.
Royal Bakery|BARBARA|You're NOT getting my number.
Royal Bakery|JERRY|Oh so you still don't believe us.
Royal Bakery|CLERK|47!
Royal Bakery|BARBARA|That’s Us.
Royal Bakery|ELAINE|Ohhh, OK, fine, fine, go ahead. But listen let me tell you something as soon as I get there I'm going to tell everyone what a jerk you are.
Royal Bakery|BARBARA|Well, I'll be there ahead of you and I'LL be telling them what a jerk YOU are. . . . (turns to the counter) I'll have the chocolate babka.
Royal Bakery|CLERK|You're lucky Mrs. Benedict it's our last one.
Royal Bakery|action|Elaine and Jerry’s knees buckle and both have an anguished look when they hear about the last chocolate babka
Liquor Store|GEORGE|Alright, what are we getting? It's hot in here!
Liquor Store|action|Kramer looking around the store at the wines, he smacks his hands together and rubs
Liquor Store|KRAMER|Ooo, What do you say we get a Mouton Cadet?
Liquor Store|GEORGE|What's that?
Liquor Store|KRAMER|Well its a Bordeaux. Robust, bold, very dry. As opposed to a Beaujolais -- which is richer and fruitier. Ahh, here's one. Twelve dollars.
Liquor Store|GEORGE|Twelve dollars? I knew we should have gone to the bakery. I guarantee you they’re not getting no twelve dollar cake.
Liquor Store|KRAMER|All right look, I am going to have to pay you back later. I don't have my wallet.
Liquor Store|action|George swaggers over to Kramer
Liquor Store|GEORGE|. . . Why not?
Liquor Store|KRAMER|Because I don't like to carry my wallet. My Osteopath says that it's bad for my spine. It throws my hips off kilter. (makes a motion with his hips)
Liquor Store|GEORGE|"throws your hips off kilter" So where's your money? (pulls out his wallet)
Liquor Store|KRAMER|I never take it.
Liquor Store|GEORGE|So what do you do?
Liquor Store|KRAMER|Oh, I get by.
Royal Bakery|BARBARA|See you later (exits with the babka)
Royal Bakery|JERRY|That's the last babka. They got the last babka.
Royal Bakery|ELAINE|I know. They're going in first with the last babka.
Royal Bakery|JERRY|That was our babka.
Royal Bakery|ELAINE|You can't beat a babka.
Royal Bakery|JERRY|We had that babka.
Royal Bakery|ELAINE|(exhales) They're going to be heroes.
Royal Bakery|JERRY|Well what are we going to do now. If we can't get the babka the whole thing's useless.
Royal Bakery|ELAINE|Well how about a carrot cake?
Royal Bakery|JERRY|Carrot cake? Now w-why is that a cake? You don't make carrots into a cake. I'm sorry.
Royal Bakery|ELAINE|Black Forrest?
Royal Bakery|JERRY|Black Forrest? Too scary. You're in the Forrest, oohh.
Royal Bakery|JERRY|How about a Napoleon?
Royal Bakery|ELAINE|Napoleon? Who's he to have a cake? He was a ruthless war monger. Might as well get Mengele.
Royal Bakery|JERRY|That was our babka. We had that babka!
Royal Bakery|ELAINE|What's this one?
Royal Bakery|CLERK|That, Cinnamon Babka.
Royal Bakery|ELAINE|(gasp)
Royal Bakery|JERRY|Another babka?
Royal Bakery|CLERK|There's chocolate and there's cinnamon.
Royal Bakery|JERRY|Well-well we got to get the cinnamon.
Royal Bakery|ELAINE|No, but they got the chocolate. We'll be going in with lesser babka.
Royal Bakery|JERRY|I beg your pardon? Cinnamon takes a back seat to no babka. People love cinnamon. It should be on tables in restaurants along with salt and pepper. Anytime anyone says, "Oh This is so good. What's in it?" The answer invariably comes back, Cinnamon. Cinnamon. Again and again. Lesser babka - I think not.
Royal Bakery|CLERK|49?
Royal Bakery|ELAINE|I'll have a cinnamon babka.
Royal Bakery|JERRY|… and a black and white cookie, for me. Peace!
Royal Bakery|action|Jerry puts up the 2 finger peace sign and smiles

Out on the street|GEORGE|Are you crazy?! What are you doing?! You'll get us killed!
Out on the street|KRAMER|What?
Out on the street|GEORGE|Don't go shouting we got a hundred dollar bill. People will be jumping out of windows on top of us.
Out on the street|KRAMER|Alright, Let's go but something. Then we'll get some change.
Out on the street|GEORGE|I am not buying something just to get change.
Out on the street|KRAMER|George, there's a news stand right over there. Now come on.

Out on the street|action|George grabs the Forum and walks a few steps over by the magazines -- Kramer follows him 
Out on the street|KRAMER|Why? No, that’ll make great dinner party conversation. We'll read the letters at the dinner table.
Out on the street|GEORGE|Oh, that's nice.
Out on the street|action|Kramer takes a bite of the Clark Bar
Out on the street|KRAMER|Come on, did you ever read one of these?
Out on the street|action|Kramer take the forum from George and starts to leaf through it
Out on the street|GEORGE|It's not real. They're all made up.
Out on the street|KRAMER|Ohh, it's real.
Out on the street|GEORGE|Well you know there is an unusual number of people in this country having sex with AMPUTEES! (grabs the forum from Kramer and walks over to the clerk) . . . Penthouse forum, newspaper, gum, Clark Bar.

Out on the street|KRAMER|You better be careful with that thing... You'll start a war.
Royal Bakery|action|Jerry and Elaine are waiting in line, Jerry takes a bite of his cookie and then speaks
Royal Bakery|JERRY|Uhm, see the key to eating a Black and White cookie, Elaine, is you want to get some black and some white in each bite. Nothing mixes better than, vanilla and chocolate. And yet still somehow racial harmony eludes us. If people would only *Look to the Cookie* -- all our problems would be solved.
Royal Bakery|ELAINE|Well your views on race relations are just, fascinating. You really should do an Op-Ed piece for the Times. (Op-Ed stands for Opinions and Editorials)
Royal Bakery|JERRY|Hmm. Look to the cookie Elaine... Look to the cookie.
Royal Bakery|action|Jerry sees a black man on the other side of the bakery eating the same cookie -- Jerry raises his cookie up and so does the man -- in a moment of racial harmony & unity to which he just spoke of.
Royal Bakery|ELAINE|(looking in the box) Well what is this?
Royal Bakery|JERRY|What?
Royal Bakery|ELAINE|It's a hair.
Royal Bakery|JERRY|Oh, oh take it back. Let's get another one.
Royal Bakery|ELAINE|No, we're late as it is. I'll just take it off.
Royal Bakery|JERRY|No no come on really, get another one. It’ll take a second.
Royal Bakery|ELAINE|Alright, alright.
Royal Bakery|action|they walk back up to the counter
Royal Bakery|ELAINE|Excuse me.
Royal Bakery|ELAINE|No noo no, we just bought this. . . . Um, you sold us a cake with a (quietly) hair on it.
Royal Bakery|CLERK|You have to take a number.
Royal Bakery|ELAINE|We waited fifteen minutes for this. Tst - YOU SELL ME A CAKE WITH A HAIR ON IT. Then you want me to wait? . . . What are you doing (to Jerry taking a number) you’re gonna wait now?
Royal Bakery|JERRY|Well, I'm not going to eat a cake with a hair on it.
Royal Bakery|ELAINE|Well it was a little hair. I took it off.
Royal Bakery|JERRY|A little hair? Do you think that makes it better?
Royal Bakery|ELAINE|What if it's your hair?
Royal Bakery|JERRY|What if it's your hair?
Royal Bakery|ELAINE|(Wh-wh) What is wrong with my hair? Nobody takes better care of their hair than me. You can serve dinner on my head.
Royal Bakery|JERRY|Who needs that misty herbal rain water crap they sell in the health food store. I use Prell, the hard stuff. Hundred proof - takes your roots out. (pretends to pull hair out)
Royal Bakery|ELAINE|Okay, fine, we'll just wait until she calls the number.
Royal Bakery|JERRY|Well, maybe we should just forget about the cake?
Royal Bakery|ELAINE|No I'm bringing cake! (looking worried and apprehensive)
Liquor store|GEORGE|All right we got the wine. Aren't we lucky? We got wine. Whoopee Whoa! Imagine if we didn't bring the wine. We'd be shunned by society. Outcasts! WHERE'S YOUR WINE? GET OUT!
Liquor store|action|George picks up the bottle of wine from the counter. George and Kramer start walking to the door
Liquor store|KRAMER|(reading from the Penthouse Forum) "I know this is going to sound like a crazy fantasy but every word of this story is true…" (exits to street) " A few weeks ago my girlfriend happened to mention to me how attractive she thought our new neighbor Linda was…"
Liquor store|GEORGE|L-Look at this?
Liquor store|KRAMER|Ahh.
Liquor store|GEORGE|Somebody double parked and blocked us in. D-DOES ANYBODY KNOW WHOSE CAR THAT IS? Maybe there's a note on it. Ohh-oh brother. No, no note. Can you believe this?
Liquor store|KRAMER|"…well of course I noticed it too with those cannibal breasts and pouty lips. I don't have to tell you she was a knock out…." (turns the page)
Still on street but much later -- it’s night|GEORGE|I really can not comprehend how stupid people could be sometimes. Can you comprehend it?
Still on street but much later -- it’s night|KRAMER|No, no I can't comprehend it?
Still on street but much later -- it’s night|GEORGE|I mean we can put a man on the moon but we're still basically very stupid. The guy who's car this is? He could be one of the guys that built the rocket. You see what I'm saying?
Still on street but much later -- it’s night|KRAMER|Well yeah, yeah. He could build the rocket, but-but he's still stupid for double-parking and blocking somebody in.
Still on street but much later -- it’s night|GEORGE|So you really understand my point about building a rocket and double-parking.
Still on street but much later -- it’s night|KRAMER|Yeah, on one hand he's smart with rockets and on the other hand he's dumb with parking. . . . It's cold out here huh?
Still on street but much later -- it’s night|GEORGE|Maybe it's not even stupidity. Maybe it's just a blatant disregard for basic human decency. Yeah this how dictator's start. Do you think Mussolini would circle the block six times looking for a spot?
Still on street but much later -- it’s night|KRAMER|How about Idi Amin, huh?
Still on street but much later -- it’s night|GEORGE|I’ll tell you, if I was running for office I would ask for the death penalty for double-parkers. If this is allowed to go on this is not a society. THIS IS ANARCHY!
Still on street but much later -- it’s night|KRAMER|Are those shoes comfortable?
Still on street but much later -- it’s night|GEORGE|No not really.
Still on street but much later -- it’s night|KRAMER|Cause they look comfortable.
Still on street but much later -- it’s night|GEORGE|I know that's why I bought `em but they're not comfortable.
Royal Bakery|ELAINE|Why couldn't we just take the hair off and go?
Royal Bakery|JERRY|No. That’s out of the question.
Royal Bakery|ELAINE|Whhhy?
Royal Bakery|JERRY|Because I had a bad experience with a hair when I was younger.
Royal Bakery|ELAINE|What happened?
Royal Bakery|JERRY|I'd rather not talk about it.
Royal Bakery|ELAINE|You can't tell me?
Royal Bakery|JERRY|All right . . . . I once found a hair in my Farina and I freaked out.
Royal Bakery|action|*Farina: A meal or flour obtained chiefly from cereals, nuts, potatoes or Indian Corn, and used as a breakfast food.
Royal Bakery|ELAINE|You found a hair in your Farina?
Royal Bakery|JERRY|Yeah.
Royal Bakery|ELAINE|What happened?
Royal Bakery|JERRY|Well I started screaming, "There's a hair in my farina. There's a hair in my farina." Then I ran out of the house and I was running and running. And like I was little but I could run very fast. And I-I just kept running (In the background -- CLERK’S VOICE: 57) and they found me like three hours later collapsed at a construction site.
Royal Bakery|ELAINE|(quietly) Wow. Who's hair was it?

Royal Bakery|JERRY|Oh, good.
Royal Bakery|action|Elaine and Jerry walk up to the counter. She sets the box on the counter with a thud
Royal Bakery|ELAINE|You sold us a hair with a cake around it. We'd like another one.

Royal Bakery|JERRY|Oh, that's lovely.
Royal Bakery|ELAINE|Ah,
Royal Bakery|JERRY|That’s what you want to see, yeah. . . . Yeah, you want to trade your hair for some phlegm.
Royal Bakery|action|coughing and coughing
Royal Bakery|JERRY|Yeah that’s a good deal -- you win the Pennant with that trade, hair for phlegm.
Royal Bakery|CLERK|Here you are. (hands Elaine the cake box)
Royal Bakery|ELAINE|Okay. Alright we got the cake now. Where is George and Kramer?
