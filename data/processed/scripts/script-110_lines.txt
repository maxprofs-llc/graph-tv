Baseball diamond in the park|ELAINE|Because this woman came in with a dog and Ruby called the dog the same word they used when they were pointing at me…ge ge ge
Baseball diamond in the park|KRAMER|You know, maybe in Korean "dog" isn't an insult. Could be like the word "fox" to us. Oh, she's a DOG!
Baseball diamond in the park|JERRY|Why don't you go to another nail shop?
Baseball diamond in the park|ELAINE|Because they're the best Jerry, the best. Look. Maybe I'm just being paranoid.

Monk's|ELAINE|Anyway, Mr. Costanza, what I want you to do is to come to the shop with me and tell me what they are saying. You do speak Korean?
Monk's|FRANK|I once talked to the reverend Yung Son Moon. He bought two Jesus statues from me. He's a hell of a nice guy.
Monk's|ELAINE|uh, ha.
Monk's|FRANK|Ever see that face on him? Like a Biiig apple pie.
Monk's|ELAINE|Yeah, yeah. Uh, uh listen Mr. Costanza, if uh, if you do this for me I'll get you a manicure, I'll pay for it. Or you can get a pedicure if you want.

Monk's|ELAINE|Uh, Mr. Costanza, I …
Monk's|FRANK|No, I feel I need to unburden myself. I loved her very deeply. But the clash of cultures was too much. Her family would not accept me.
Monk's|ELAINE|Mr. Costanza, I, …
Monk's|FRANK|Maybe it was because I refused to take off my shoes. Again, the foot odour problem. Her father would look at me and say, " eno enoa juang ". Which means, "this guy - this is not my kind of guy".
