JERRY and ELAINE are walking down the street and Kramer is parking his car|ELAINE|Is he happy?
At the restaurant! GEORGE: is coming from the bathroom to sit with his bride-to-be.|GEORGE|I will never understand the bathrooms in this country. Why is it that the doors on the stalls do not come all the way down to the floor?
At the restaurant! GEORGE: is coming from the bathroom to sit with his bride-to-be.|SUSAN|Well, maybe it's so you can see if there's someone in there.
At the restaurant! GEORGE: is coming from the bathroom to sit with his bride-to-be.|GEORGE|Isn't that why we have locks on the doors?
At the restaurant! GEORGE: is coming from the bathroom to sit with his bride-to-be.|SUSAN|Well, as a backup system, in case the lock is broken, you can see if it's taken.
At the restaurant! GEORGE: is coming from the bathroom to sit with his bride-to-be.|GEORGE|A backup system? We're designing bathroom doors with our legs exposed in anticipation of the locks not working? That's not a system. That's a complete breakdown of the system.
At the restaurant! GEORGE: is coming from the bathroom to sit with his bride-to-be.|SUSAN|Can we change the subject, please?
At the restaurant! GEORGE: is coming from the bathroom to sit with his bride-to-be.|GEORGE|Why? What's wrong with the subject? This is a bad subject?
At the restaurant! GEORGE: is coming from the bathroom to sit with his bride-to-be.|SUSAN|No, fine. If you wanna keep talking about it, we'll talk about it.
At the restaurant! GEORGE: is coming from the bathroom to sit with his bride-to-be.|GEORGE|It's not that I want to keep talking about it? just think that the subject should resolve itself based on its own momentum.
At the restaurant! GEORGE: is coming from the bathroom to sit with his bride-to-be.|SUSAN|Well, I didn't think that it had any momentum.
At the restaurant! GEORGE: is coming from the bathroom to sit with his bride-to-be.|GEORGE|(To himself) How am I gonna do this? I'm engaged to this woman? She doesn't even like me. Change the subject? Toilets were the subject. We don't even share the same interests.
Jerry's|JERRY|Yeah, he seems pretty happy.
Jerry's|ELAINE|Well, that's all that counts, I guess.
Jerry's|JERRY|What's the matter?
Jerry's|ELAINE|Oh, nothin'.
Jerry's|JERRY|Well, you don't seem too enthused about the whole thing.
Jerry's|ELAINE|Well, what do you want me to do?
Jerry's|JERRY|Well, at least have some reaction to it.
Jerry's|ELAINE|…Well, I don't.
Jerry's|JERRY|Maybe you're a little jealous.
Jerry's|ELAINE|Oh, what? You think I wanna marry George?
Jerry's|JERRY|No! But maybe you wish it was you who was getting married, not him.
Jerry's|ELAINE|Oh, please! That is the last thing that I want.

Jerry's|KRAMER|It can never be erased. It'll follow us wherever we go for the rest of our lives. I'll never be able to get a job. I mean, doesn't that concern you? Everything I've worked for...down the drain because of one stupid mistake. I mean, aren't we entitled to make one mistake in our lives, Jerry?
Jerry's|JERRY|We're gonna change the system.

Monk's|JERRY|Well, at least you probably had some, uh, pretty good make-up sex after.
Monk's|GEORGE|I didn't have any sex.
Monk's|JERRY|You didn't have make-up sex? How could you not have make-up sex? I mean that's the best feature of the heavy relationship.
Monk's|GEORGE|I didn't have make-up sex.
Monk's|JERRY|In your situation the only sex you're going to have better than make-up sex is if you're dent to prison and you have a conjugal visit.

Elaine's|JERRY|It didn't take much prodding either, I must say.
Elaine's|ELAINE|Can he do that?

Rabbi's apartment|RABBI|Was that a problem for you?
Rabbi's apartment|ELAINE|Of course it was a problem for me. . . . You didn't, you didn't tell anyone else about this, did you?

Jerry's apartment|ELAINE|Are you kidding? I have seen the changes in you the past couple of years. Man, you have grown. You've matured.
Jerry's apartment|GEORGE|Well, I guess I'm getting older.
Jerry's apartment|ELAINE|Oh! Well, I just think it's wonderful. Honestly! I've gotta run, but um, please, please give my best to Susan.
Jerry's apartment|GEORGE|Yeah.
Jerry's apartment|ELAINE|My most, just heartfelt congratulations.
Jerry's apartment|GEORGE|Yeah. Thanks. Hey, listen, if you ever get a date, maybe the four of us could go out together sometime.
Jerry's apartment|ELAINE|Yes! Yes, yes. Sure.
Jerry's apartment|GEORGE|Wait, as a matter of fact, wasn't there some guy in your building that you said you liked? He lived up on the fifth floor or something.
Jerry's apartment|ELAINE|Yes. Yes, yes. Yes.
Jerry's apartment|GEORGE|Yeah! Boy, she is something, isn't she?
Jerry's apartment|JERRY|Yeah, she's something else. Hey, so what happened? Did you hold your ground or...uh…
Jerry's apartment|GEORGE|Nope. I wept like a baby.
Jerry's apartment|JERRY|What?
Jerry's apartment|GEORGE|Well, I started to tell her and then all of the sudden, for some reason, I just burst into tears.
Jerry's apartment|JERRY|You cried?
Jerry's apartment|GEORGE|I bawled uncontrollably. I just poured my guts out. And I'll tell you, Jerry, it was incredible. I never realized how powerful these tears are. I could have postponed it another five years if I wanted to.
Jerry's apartment|JERRY|Sorry about that movie-thing. I was joking around.
Jerry's apartment|KRAMER|Sorry? Are you kidding? You did me the biggest favor of my life. I spoke to a lawyer, we're suing for millions.
Jerry's apartment|JERRY|Suing? What for?
Jerry's apartment|KRAMER|The coffee was too hot.
Jerry's apartment|JERRY|It's supposed to be hot.
Jerry's apartment|KRAMER|Not THAT hot.
At George's home. He and Susan are in bed watching TV|RABBI|(On TV) The prophet Isaah tells us without friends our lives are empty and meaningless.
At George's home. He and Susan are in bed watching TV|GEORGE|Wait. Whoa! That's the Rabbi from Elaine's building. I just met this guy the other day.
At George's home. He and Susan are in bed watching TV|RABBI|A young lady I know, let's call her Elaine, happened to find herself overwhelmed with feelings of resentment and hostility for her friend, let's call him George. She felt that George was somewhat of a loser and that she was the one who deserved to be married first. She also happened to mention to me that her friend had wondered if going to a prostitute while you're engaged is considered cheating. His feeling was they're never going to see each other again so what's the difference. But that is a subject for another sermon. Now, I'd like to close with a psalm.
