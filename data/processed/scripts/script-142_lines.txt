Morning at Jerry apartment|ELAINE|Forty bucks? Are they Sable?
Morning at Jerry apartment|JERRY|No, but the difference is negligible.

Morning at Jerry apartment|action|Exit Elaine and Jerry. Newman reveals himself, he was hiding in the bathroom.

Back to Elaine's office|ELAINE|That's a rat hat?
Back to Elaine's office|IPSWITCH|And a poorly made one, even by rat hat standards. I have no choice but to recommend your prompt termination to the board of directors. Nothing short of the approval of Peterman himself will save you this time.
Back to Elaine's office|ELAINE|But, but, he's in the Burmese jungle.
Back to Elaine's office|IPSWITCH|And quite mad too from what I hear.
Back to Elaine's office|ELAINE|Wait a minute, wait a minute. Can I fire you?
