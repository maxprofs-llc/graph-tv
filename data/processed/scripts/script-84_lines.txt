Elaine's Office at Pendant|TOBY|Oh, look at this one! It's saying, 'I'm a coffee table, put some coffee on me! Oh, the hotter the better, that's what I'm here for!' (laughs)
Elaine's Office at Pendant|ELAINE|You know actually, I've got some work I gotta do, so...
Elaine's Office at Pendant|KRAMER|Hey, how about if the book came with these little fold-out legs...so the book itself becomes a coffee table?

Jerry's Apartment|action|Elaine and Jerry later that day.
Jerry's Apartment|JERRY|Yeah, that's real interesting. Elaine, listen, tell me if you think this is funny - (reads comedy he's written) "Men definitely hit the remote more than women...men don't care what's on TV, men only care what else is on TV. Women want to see what the show is before they change the channel, because men hunt and women nest."
Jerry's Apartment|JERRY|You don't know? Come on, that's gold!
Jerry's Apartment|ELAINE|Well, I don't know about "gold."
Jerry's Apartment|JERRY|Oh, that's gold, baby.

Monk's|ROBIN|George...
Monk's|GEORGE|With the orange hair, and the big clown shirt with the ruffles...
Monk's|ROBIN|George...
Monk's|GEORGE|He had a TV show! He had cartoons!
Monk's|ROBIN|George! Forget Bozo, George. Bozo's out. He's finished. It's over for Bozo.
Monk's|GEORGE|You know, when I was a kid, we didn't have these elaborate birthday parties w-with catered food and entertainment. I remember my 7th birthday party...
Monk's|action|Flashback of George at seven, sitting in front of a birthday cake with a shocked expression on his face, while Frank and Estelle scream at him
Monk's|FRANK|Blow out the candles! Blow out the candles, I said! Blow out the damn candles!
Monk's|ESTELLE|Stop it, Frank! You're killing him!
Monk's|FRANK|Blow out the candles!!
Monk's|action|Return from flashback
Monk's|ROBIN|Well, this time, you can blow out the candles.

Comedy Club|TOBY|Oh yeah, we don't want some jerk sitting in front of us, it'll be like, 'Hey, big head, can you move out of the way? I didn't pay a cover charge to stare at your bald spot.' (laughs)

George talking to Eric, the clown at Robin's son's birthday party.|GEORGE|Bozo?
George talking to Eric, the clown at Robin's son's birthday party.|ERIC|No.
George talking to Eric, the clown at Robin's son's birthday party.|GEORGE|B-O-Z-O?
George talking to Eric, the clown at Robin's son's birthday party.|ERIC|Sorry, I...
George talking to Eric, the clown at Robin's son's birthday party.|GEORGE|You've never heard of Bozo the Clown?
George talking to Eric, the clown at Robin's son's birthday party.|ERIC|No!
George talking to Eric, the clown at Robin's son's birthday party.|GEORGE|How could you not know who Bozo the Clown is?
George talking to Eric, the clown at Robin's son's birthday party.|ERIC|I don't know, I just don't.
George talking to Eric, the clown at Robin's son's birthday party.|GEORGE|How can you call yourself a clown and not know who Bozo is?
George talking to Eric, the clown at Robin's son's birthday party.|ERIC|Hey, man - what are you hassling me for? This is just a gig, it's not my life. I don't know who Bozo is, what - is he a clown?
George talking to Eric, the clown at Robin's son's birthday party.|GEORGE|Is he a clown? What, are you kidding me!?
George talking to Eric, the clown at Robin's son's birthday party.|ERIC|Well, what is he?
George talking to Eric, the clown at Robin's son's birthday party.|GEORGE|Yes, he's a clown!
George talking to Eric, the clown at Robin's son's birthday party.|ERIC|Alright, so what's the big deal! There's millions of clowns!
George talking to Eric, the clown at Robin's son's birthday party.|GEORGE|Alright, just forget it.
George talking to Eric, the clown at Robin's son's birthday party.|ERIC|Me forget it? You should forget it! You're livin' in the past, man! You're hung up on some clown from the sixties, man!
George talking to Eric, the clown at Robin's son's birthday party.|GEORGE|Alright, very good, very good...go fold your little balloon animals, Eric. Eric! (chuckles) What kind of name is that for a clown, huh?
George talking to Eric, the clown at Robin's son's birthday party.|GEORGE|Well, I do what I can. (Robin comes over.)
George talking to Eric, the clown at Robin's son's birthday party.|ROBIN|Hi Mom, how's everything?
George talking to Eric, the clown at Robin's son's birthday party.|ROBIN|The burgers should be ready in a minute.
George talking to Eric, the clown at Robin's son's birthday party.|GEORGE|Ah, great, great. (sniffs) What's that smell? Smoke? (walks to the kitchen) Hey everybody, I think I smell some smoke back here...(smoke boils into the doorway.) FIRE! FIRE! Get out of the way!
George talking to Eric, the clown at Robin's son's birthday party.|action|The kids all scream and the party goes crazy. George barrels out of the kitchen, pushing down kids, clowns and old ladies in a mad panic to escape. He runs out the door and leaves everyone behind.
George talking to Eric, the clown at Robin's son's birthday party.|action|Cut to George sitting in the back of an ambulance with an oxygen mask on his face.
George talking to Eric, the clown at Robin's son's birthday party.|ERIC|There he is! That's him! (Tries to clobber George with his big shoe.)
George talking to Eric, the clown at Robin's son's birthday party.|action|Cut to George attempting to explain his cowardly actions to Robin, her mother, Eric and a fireman from the back of the ambulance at the party.
George talking to Eric, the clown at Robin's son's birthday party.|ROBIN|But you yelled "get out of my way"!
George talking to Eric, the clown at Robin's son's birthday party.|GEORGE|Because! Because, as the leader...if I die...then all hope is lost! Who would lead? The clown? Instead of castigating me, you should all be thanking me. What kind of a topsy-turvy world do we live in, where-where heroes are cast as villains? Brave men as cowards?
George talking to Eric, the clown at Robin's son's birthday party.|ROBIN|But I saw you push the women and children out of the way in a mad panic! I saw you knock them down! And when you ran out, you left everyone behind!
George talking to Eric, the clown at Robin's son's birthday party.|GEORGE|Seemingly. Seemingly, to the untrained eye, I can fully understand how you got that impression. What looked like pushing...what looked like knocking down...was a safety precaution! In a fire, you stay close to the ground, am I right? And when I ran out that door, I was not leaving anyone behind! Oh, quite the contrary! I risked my life making sure that exit was clear. Any other questions?
George talking to Eric, the clown at Robin's son's birthday party.|FIREMAN|How do you live with yourself?
George talking to Eric, the clown at Robin's son's birthday party.|GEORGE|Its not easy.
Monk's|action|George and Jerry at the usual booth
Monk's|GEORGE|So she doesn't want to see me anymore.
Monk's|JERRY|Did you knock her over too, or just the kids?
Monk's|GEORGE|No, her too. And her mother.
Monk's|JERRY|Really? Her mother.
Monk's|GEORGE|Yeah. I may have stepped on her arm, too, I don't know.
Monk's|JERRY|You probably couldn't see because of the smoke.
Monk's|GEORGE|Yeah. But it was somebody's arm.
Monk's|JERRY|Hmm. So you feel "women and children first," in this day and age, is somewhat of an antiquated notion.
Monk's|GEORGE|To some degree.
Monk's|JERRY|So basically, it's every man, woman, child, and invalid for themselves.
Monk's|GEORGE|In a manner of speaking.
Monk's|JERRY|Yeah, well, it's honest.
Monk's|GEORGE|Yeah. She should be commending me for treating everyone like equals.
Monk's|JERRY|Well, perhaps when she's released from the burn center, she'll see things differently.
Monk's|GEORGE|Perhaps.
Monk's|JERRY|So, what was the fire? Just a couple of greasy hamburgers?
Monk's|GEORGE|Yeah. Eric the Clown put it out with his big shoe.
Monk's|JERRY|By the way, did you see this? (Hands George a magazine)
Monk's|GEORGE|What's that?
Monk's|JERRY|It's the Leonard Christian article about my show. Plus my gig in Miami got cancelled, I betcha it's because of the article.
Monk's|GEORGE|Wow, he really does a number on you. (reads) "Seinfeld froze like a deer in the headlights in the face of incessant heckling."
Monk's|JERRY|I should have let her have it! I held back because of Kramer.
Monk's|GEORGE|You know what you oughta do. You should go to her office and heckle her.
Monk's|JERRY|Yeah, right.
Monk's|GEORGE|You know, like all the comedians always say, 'How would you like it if I came to where you work and heckled you?'
Monk's|JERRY|Yeah, that'd be something.
Monk's|GEORGE|I'm not kidding, you should do it.
Monk's|JERRY|But wouldn't that be the ultimate comedian's revenge? I've always had a fantasy about doing that.
Monk's|GEORGE|Well, go ahead! Do it!
Monk's|JERRY|Why can't I?
Monk's|GEORGE|No reason!
Monk's|JERRY|You know what? I think I'm gonna do that! She came down to where I work, I'll go down to where she works!
Monk's|GEORGE|This is unprecedented!
Monk's|JERRY|There's no precedent, baby!
Monk's|GEORGE|What...are you using my babies now?
Toby in her office at Pendant.|action|Jerry pokes his head in the door.
Toby in her office at Pendant.|JERRY|Hey, nice shoes. What, you wear sandals to work? It's always nice to walk into a room and get the aroma of feet. That's real conducive to the work atmosphere. I'm sure your co-workers really appreciate it. 'Hey, let's go eat in Toby's office. Great idea! We can check on her bunions!'
Toby in her office at Pendant.|TOBY|You know, I have work to do here! I'm very busy!

Toby in her office at Pendant.|JERRY|Security? Well, I don't know how you're gonna make it in this business if you can't take it! Ya gotta be tough! Booo! Boooo!

Jerry's Apartment|action|Kramer and Jerry
Jerry's Apartment|KRAMER|What did you go up there to heckle her for?
Jerry's Apartment|JERRY|Because she came down to the club and heckled me! Give her a taste of her own medicine! (George enters.)
Jerry's Apartment|KRAMER|Oh, YEAH! You gave her a taste of medicine, alright.
Jerry's Apartment|JERRY|Well, I didn't want her to have an accident.
Jerry's Apartment|GEORGE|What accident?
Jerry's Apartment|KRAMER|Well, after he heckled Toby, she got so upset, she ran out of the building and a street sweeper ran over her foot and severed her pinky toe.
Jerry's Apartment|GEORGE|That's unbelievable!
Jerry's Apartment|KRAMER|Yeah! Then after the ambulance left, I found the toe! So I put it in a Cracker Jack box, filled it with ice, and took off for the hospital.
Jerry's Apartment|GEORGE|Wha.. you ran?
Jerry's Apartment|KRAMER|No, I jumped on the bus. I told the driver, "I got a toe here, buddy - step on it."
Jerry's Apartment|GEORGE|Holy cow!
Jerry's Apartment|KRAMER|Yeah, yeah, then all of a sudden, this guy pulls out a gun. Well, I knew any delay is gonna cost her her pinky toe, so I got out of the seat and I started walking towards him. He says, "Where do you think you're going, Cracker Jack?" I said, "Well, I got a little prize for ya, buddy - " (Kramer throws two quick punches and a massive uppercut) - knocked him out cold!
Jerry's Apartment|GEORGE|How could you do that?!
Jerry's Apartment|KRAMER|Then everybody is screamin,' because the driver, he's passed out from all the commotion...the bus is out of control! So, I grab him by the collar, I take him out of the seat, I get behind the wheel and now I'm drivin' the bus.
Jerry's Apartment|GEORGE|You're Batman.
Jerry's Apartment|KRAMER|Yeah. Yeah, I am Batman. Then the mugger, he comes to, and he starts chokin' me! So I'm fightin' him off with one hand and I kept drivin' the bus with the other, y'know? Then I managed to open up the door, and I kicked him out the door you know with my foot, you know - at the next stop.
Jerry's Apartment|JERRY|You kept makin' all the stops?
Jerry's Apartment|KRAMER|Well, people kept ringin' the bell!
Jerry's Apartment|GEORGE|Well, wha-what about the toe? What happened to the toe?
Jerry's Apartment|KRAMER|Well! I am happy to say that the little guy is back in place at the end of the line.

Jerry's Apartment|JERRY|She got the promotion?
Jerry's Apartment|JERRY|Why?
Jerry's Apartment|ELAINE|I'll tell ya why. Because of her pinky toe, that's why. Because Lippman felt so sorry for her, he didn't want to hurt her feelings.
Jerry's Apartment|JERRY|Too bad.
Jerry's Apartment|ELAINE|Sure, the pinky toe is cute! But, I mean, what is it? It's useless! It does nothing. It's got that little nail that is just impossible to cut. What do we need it for?
