setting: NBC, pilot's set|JERRY|No I'm not. (to Michael) George. Is Haagen-Dazs Danish?
setting: NBC, pilot's set|MICHAEL|What do you mean Danish?

(the guy looks at George with a bothered face. George then walks up to Tom and takes him away from Jerry and Michael to talk to him in private)(to Tom) You see, you're going: "They fooled *me* Jerry!" (George shakes his head with disapproval) You wanna hit 'fooled' more: "They *fooled* me Jerry!". You see the difference?
setting: NBC, pilot's set|TOM|I'm not gonna say it like that.
setting: NBC, pilot's set|GEORGE|Just a suggestion. (chuckles and walks back to the yelling guy)
setting: NBC, pilot's set|GEORGE|(very casual and raising his hand in the air) Yep. That's five!
setting: NBC, pilot's set|JERRY|George? (walks away to talk privately. George, still casual, taps on Jerry's shoulder) I don't have a lot of experience with this acting stuff. But from what I can gather, they're a little touchy about being told how to say the lines.
setting: NBC, pilot's set|GEORGE|Why is that?
setting: NBC, pilot's set|JERRY|I don't know, but they don't seem to like it. By the way how am I doing?
setting: NBC, pilot's set|GEORGE|Oh, you're fine... you're fine. (looking at Tom in the back and then quieter to Jerry) So you think this guy playing Kramer took the raisins?

If you ever want to tell me about it, the door to my office is always opened. In the event that I get an office. You'll come in, we'll talk about the raisins. We'll have a nice laugh.
