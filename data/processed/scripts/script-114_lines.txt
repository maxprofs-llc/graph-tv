Elaine's bedroom - phone rings|ELAINE|Hello
Elaine's bedroom - phone rings|JAMES|This is your wake up service. It's 7:15
Elaine's bedroom - phone rings|ELAINE|Oh, god. OH, I could use a few more hours sleep.
Elaine's bedroom - phone rings|JAMES|Hot date last night?
Elaine's bedroom - phone rings|ELAINE|I wish.
Elaine's bedroom - phone rings|JAMES|A woman with a sexy voice like yours its hard to believe your waking up alone.
Elaine's bedroom - phone rings|ELAINE|Really? Thank you., wake up service . . . person.
Elaine's bedroom - phone rings|JAMES|Call me James.
Elaine's bedroom - phone rings|ELAINE|Oh, all right, James. He he he
Monks|GEORGE|Your wake up guy asked you out?
Monks|ELAINE|Yeah, I've never seen him but I feel like we have this weirdly intimate relationship. I mean, I'm lying in bed, I'm wearing my nightie,
Monks|JERRY|I don't know. Blind date?
Monks|ELAINE|What? You're going to go out with my cousin Holly. You've never met her.
Monks|JERRY|Yeah, but I've seen pictures of her.
Monks|ELAINE|At least I've spoken to my guy. You're going out on a deaf date.
Monks|JERRY|I think I'd rather go out on a deaf date than a blind date. The question is whether you'd rather date the blind or the deaf.
Monks|ELAINE|Ah, . . .
Monks|GEORGE|Now you're off on a topic.
Monks|JERRY|You know, I think, I would rather date the deaf.
Monks|ELAINE|Uh hu.
Monks|JERRY|Because I think the blind would probably be a little messier around the house. And lets face it they're not going to get all the crumbs. I'd possibly be walking around with a sponge.
Monks|GEORGE|You see I disagree. I'd rather be dating the blind. You know you could let the house go. You could let yourself go. A good looking blind woman doesn't even know you're not good enough for her.
Monks|ELAINE|I think she'd figure it out.
Monks|action|waitress places plates on the table
Monks|ELAINE|What? What is this?
Monks|JERRY|Veggie sandwich and a grapefruit.
Monks|ELAINE|Veggie sandwich and a grapefruit? What are you turning into?

Yankee Stadium|WILHELM|George, have you seen Morgan?
Yankee Stadium|GEORGE|No.
Yankee Stadium|WILHELM|He's been coming in late all week. Is there something wrong?
Yankee Stadium|GEORGE|No, not that I know of. (winks)
Yankee Stadium|WILHELM|Really? Make sure he signs this. Oh, look George, if there's a problem with Morgan you can tell me.
Yankee Stadium|GEORGE|Morgan? No. He's doing a great job. (winks)
Yankee Stadium|WILHELM|I understand.
Jerry's apartment|JERRY|I still can't believe, you're going out on a blind date.
Jerry's apartment|ELAINE|I'm not worried. It sounds like he's really good looking.
Jerry's apartment|JERRY|You're going by sound? What are we? Whales?
Jerry's apartment|ELAINE|I think I can tell.
Jerry's apartment|JERRY|Elaine, what percentage of people would you say are good looking?
Jerry's apartment|ELAINE|Twenty-five percent.
Jerry's apartment|JERRY|Twenty-five percent, you say? No way! It's like 4 to 6 percent. It's a twenty to one shot.
Jerry's apartment|ELAINE|You're way off.
Jerry's apartment|JERRY|Way off? Have you been to the motor vehicle bureau? It's like a leper colony down there.
Jerry's apartment|ELAINE|So what you are saying is that 90 to 95 percent of the population is undateable?
Jerry's apartment|JERRY|UNDATEABLE!
Jerry's apartment|ELAINE|Then how are all these people getting together?
Jerry's apartment|JERRY|Alcohol.
Jerry's apartment|ELAINE|(to George who is winking) What is your problem?
Jerry's apartment|GEORGE|No problem here.
Jerry's apartment|ELAINE|You keep winking at me. That's really obnoxious.
Jerry's apartment|GEORGE|I had no idea.
Jerry's apartment|ELAINE|Right there. Right there. You just did it again.
Jerry's apartment|GEORGE|Wait a minute. Wait a minute. It's from that grapefruit that Jerry squirted at me.
Jerry's apartment|ELAINE|You're eye still hurts?
Jerry's apartment|GEORGE|Yeah, yeah. You must have squirted a piece of pulp in it too.
Jerry's apartment|JERRY|Pulp couldn't make it across the table.
Jerry's apartment|GEORGE|Pulp can move, Baby! Why didn't you eat a real breakfast?
Jerry's apartment|JERRY|Hey, I eat healthy. If I have to take out an eye, that's the breaks.
Jerry's apartment|GEORGE|Wait a minute. I must have been winking down at the office. That's why Mr. Wilhelm was acting so mysteriouso.
Jerry's apartment|ELAINE|What did he think, you were flirtin' with him?
Jerry's apartment|GEORGE|Hu, oh. No he thought I was hiding something from him about Morgan.

Yankee Stadium|GEORGE|Hey, Mr. Morgan how was your massage?
Yankee Stadium|MORGAN|I had to cancel it. For some reason my wife got it into her head that it was more than just a massage.
Yankee Stadium|GEORGE|Really?
Yankee Stadium|MORGAN|Yeah, we had this big fight at lunch it looks like tonight I will be sleeping on the couch.
Yankee Stadium|GEORGE|Hey, listen don't oversleep. You can't afford to be late again.
Yankee Stadium|MORGAN|I know. Somebody around here has been giving Wilhelm the impression that I have been slacking off.
Yankee Stadium|GEORGE|Geez, Hey you know something, you should try my friend's wake up service. She swears by this thing.
Yankee Stadium|MORGAN|Costanza, you may be my only friend around here. By the way, you got that birthday card?

Jerry's apartment|JERRY|What are you saying? . . . Salad! What was I thinking? Women don't respect salad eaters.
Jerry's apartment|ELAINE|You got that right.

Holly's apartment|HOLLY|That is so funny. Did you just make that up?
Holly's apartment|JERRY|I wish I could take credit for it. It's actually the line my butcher uses when we're chewing the fat. How about that beautiful desk over there? (hides meat in napkin in jacket)
Holly's apartment|HOLLY|That was in Grandma's study.
Holly's apartment|ELAINE|What did you do, ransack the place after she died?

Monk's|GEORGE|Napkins?
Monk's|ELAINE|I mean, why? Why would I take her stupid napkins.
Monk's|JERRY|Because they were in the pockets of my jacket.
Monk's|ELAINE|They were?
Monk's|JERRY|Yes. I was using them to spit out the mutton.
