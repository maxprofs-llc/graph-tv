George and Jerry are at the coffee shop.|JERRY| So he's an eligible receiver.
George and Jerry are at the coffee shop.|GEORGE| She's confiding in him about our dates.  You always like the person you talk to about the date more than the date!  It's just a matter of time till they realize, 'Hey, we could have sex.'
George and Jerry are at the coffee shop.|JERRY| What's stopping them?
George and Jerry are at the coffee shop.|GEORGE| Exactly!  You know how they get animals to reproduce in captivity? They just put them in the same cage.
George and Jerry are at the coffee shop.|JERRY| What does he look like?
George and Jerry are at the coffee shop.|GEORGE| Oh, that's the worst part of it.  He looks just like me.
George and Jerry are at the coffee shop.|JERRY| He looks like you and he's working from the inside?
George and Jerry are at the coffee shop.|GEORGE| I look like me and I'm working from the outside.  Who do you think is in the better position?
George and Jerry are at the coffee shop.|JERRY| Not you.
George and Jerry are at the coffee shop.|GEORGE| Ho ho.  This bizarre ?harrod? experiment must end!
George and Jerry are at the coffee shop.|JERRY| We'll take a check please.
George and Jerry are at the coffee shop.|GEORGE|I gotta find a way to work this out, I love that apartment.  It's so cozy, I'm ensconced in velvet.  You know, if it were socially acceptable--

George and Jerry are at the coffee shop.|JERRY| Oh, maybe he's got no hot water.
George and Jerry are at the coffee shop.|KRAMER| Yeah, alright, fine.  You sit there and you watch while Newman takes over the world.  But he'd be a horrible leader.  And you know who's gonna suffer?  The little people; you and George.
George and Jerry are at the coffee shop.|JERRY| Are you through?
George and Jerry are at the coffee shop.|KRAMER| Oh.  I talked to Arthur Jobanian.  Yeah, the Drake's wedding?  That's off.
George and Jerry are at the coffee shop.|JERRY| The wedding is off?  What happened?

Jerry and George are entering Jerry's apartment|GEORGE| The wedding is off.  Now you can go to the Super Bowl.
Jerry and George are entering Jerry's apartment|JERRY| I can't call Tim Whatley and ask for the tickets back.

Jerry and George are entering Jerry's apartment|GEORGE| Well, didn't he regift the label maker?
Jerry and George are entering Jerry's apartment|JERRY| Possibly.
Jerry and George are entering Jerry's apartment|GEORGE| Well, if he can regift, why can't you degift?

Jerry and George are entering Jerry's apartment|JERRY| What are you gonna do about the roommate?
Jerry and George are entering Jerry's apartment|GEORGE| I gotta try and find a way to switch places with him.  It's like a Sigfried and Roy trick.
Jerry and George are entering Jerry's apartment|JERRY| Well, the pickle breath is a good start.

Jerry and George are entering Jerry's apartment|NEWMAN| Jerry?  I'm a little insulted.
Jerry and George are entering Jerry's apartment|JERRY| You're not a little anything, Newman.  So just pack it up and move it out of here.

George and Bonnie are at Bonnie's|BONNIE| George?
George and Bonnie are at Bonnie's|GEORGE| Do you hold the neck together with one hand, or are you just letting it flap in the breeze?
