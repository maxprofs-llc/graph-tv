While Jerry and Elaine are sitting on Jerry's couch watching the tube, Elaine is flipping through the channels constantly.|ELAINE|Been a while?

While Jerry and Elaine are sitting on Jerry's couch watching the tube, Elaine is flipping through the channels constantly.|JERRY|What?
While Jerry and Elaine are sitting on Jerry's couch watching the tube, Elaine is flipping through the channels constantly.|ELAINE|What was that look?
While Jerry and Elaine are sitting on Jerry's couch watching the tube, Elaine is flipping through the channels constantly.|JERRY|What look?
While Jerry and Elaine are sitting on Jerry's couch watching the tube, Elaine is flipping through the channels constantly.|ELAINE|The look you just gave me.
While Jerry and Elaine are sitting on Jerry's couch watching the tube, Elaine is flipping through the channels constantly.|JERRY|I gave a look?
While Jerry and Elaine are sitting on Jerry's couch watching the tube, Elaine is flipping through the channels constantly.|ELAINE|Yes.
While Jerry and Elaine are sitting on Jerry's couch watching the tube, Elaine is flipping through the channels constantly.|JERRY|What kind of look?
While Jerry and Elaine are sitting on Jerry's couch watching the tube, Elaine is flipping through the channels constantly.|ELAINE|I know that look.
While Jerry and Elaine are sitting on Jerry's couch watching the tube, Elaine is flipping through the channels constantly.|JERRY|Then what was it?
While Jerry and Elaine are sitting on Jerry's couch watching the tube, Elaine is flipping through the channels constantly.|ELAINE|Why should I tell you?
While Jerry and Elaine are sitting on Jerry's couch watching the tube, Elaine is flipping through the channels constantly.|JERRY|Well, you're the big look expert. I wanna see how smart you are.
While Jerry and Elaine are sitting on Jerry's couch watching the tube, Elaine is flipping through the channels constantly.|ELAINE|Trust me. I know the look. (Pause) So...
While Jerry and Elaine are sitting on Jerry's couch watching the tube, Elaine is flipping through the channels constantly.|JERRY|What?
While Jerry and Elaine are sitting on Jerry's couch watching the tube, Elaine is flipping through the channels constantly.|ELAINE|What about the look?
While Jerry and Elaine are sitting on Jerry's couch watching the tube, Elaine is flipping through the channels constantly.|JERRY|I don't know.
While Jerry and Elaine are sitting on Jerry's couch watching the tube, Elaine is flipping through the channels constantly.|ELAINE|You got something on your mind?
While Jerry and Elaine are sitting on Jerry's couch watching the tube, Elaine is flipping through the channels constantly.|JERRY|No. Things pop into your head. You?
While Jerry and Elaine are sitting on Jerry's couch watching the tube, Elaine is flipping through the channels constantly.|ELAINE|Things occur to me from time to time.
While Jerry and Elaine are sitting on Jerry's couch watching the tube, Elaine is flipping through the channels constantly.|JERRY|Yeah, me too. Well, you can't expect to just forget the past completely.
While Jerry and Elaine are sitting on Jerry's couch watching the tube, Elaine is flipping through the channels constantly.|ELAINE|No, of course not.
While Jerry and Elaine are sitting on Jerry's couch watching the tube, Elaine is flipping through the channels constantly.|JERRY|I mean, it was something we did. Probably about, what? Twenty-five times?
While Jerry and Elaine are sitting on Jerry's couch watching the tube, Elaine is flipping through the channels constantly.|ELAINE|Thirty-seven.
While Jerry and Elaine are sitting on Jerry's couch watching the tube, Elaine is flipping through the channels constantly.|JERRY|Yeah, we pretty much know what we're doin' in there. (Points to bedroom)
While Jerry and Elaine are sitting on Jerry's couch watching the tube, Elaine is flipping through the channels constantly.|ELAINE|We know the terrain.
While Jerry and Elaine are sitting on Jerry's couch watching the tube, Elaine is flipping through the channels constantly.|JERRY|No big surprises.
While Jerry and Elaine are sitting on Jerry's couch watching the tube, Elaine is flipping through the channels constantly.|ELAINE|Nope.
While Jerry and Elaine are sitting on Jerry's couch watching the tube, Elaine is flipping through the channels constantly.|JERRY|What do you think?
While Jerry and Elaine are sitting on Jerry's couch watching the tube, Elaine is flipping through the channels constantly.|ELAINE|I don't know. What do you think?
While Jerry and Elaine are sitting on Jerry's couch watching the tube, Elaine is flipping through the channels constantly.|JERRY|Well, it's something to consider.
While Jerry and Elaine are sitting on Jerry's couch watching the tube, Elaine is flipping through the channels constantly.|ELAINE|Yeah.
While Jerry and Elaine are sitting on Jerry's couch watching the tube, Elaine is flipping through the channels constantly.|JERRY|I mean, let's say we did.
While Jerry and Elaine are sitting on Jerry's couch watching the tube, Elaine is flipping through the channels constantly.|ELAINE|What if.
While Jerry and Elaine are sitting on Jerry's couch watching the tube, Elaine is flipping through the channels constantly.|JERRY|Is that like the end of the world or something?
While Jerry and Elaine are sitting on Jerry's couch watching the tube, Elaine is flipping through the channels constantly.|ELAINE|Certainly not.
While Jerry and Elaine are sitting on Jerry's couch watching the tube, Elaine is flipping through the channels constantly.|JERRY|Why shouldn't we be able to do that once in a while if we want to?
While Jerry and Elaine are sitting on Jerry's couch watching the tube, Elaine is flipping through the channels constantly.|ELAINE|I know.
While Jerry and Elaine are sitting on Jerry's couch watching the tube, Elaine is flipping through the channels constantly.|JERRY|I mean, really, what is the big deal? We go in there. (Points to the bedroom) We're in there for a while. We come right back out here. It's not complicated.
While Jerry and Elaine are sitting on Jerry's couch watching the tube, Elaine is flipping through the channels constantly.|ELAINE|It's almost stupid if we didn't.
While Jerry and Elaine are sitting on Jerry's couch watching the tube, Elaine is flipping through the channels constantly.|JERRY|It's moronic.
While Jerry and Elaine are sitting on Jerry's couch watching the tube, Elaine is flipping through the channels constantly.|ELAINE|Absurd!
While Jerry and Elaine are sitting on Jerry's couch watching the tube, Elaine is flipping through the channels constantly.|JERRY|Of course, I guess, maybe, some little problems could arise.
While Jerry and Elaine are sitting on Jerry's couch watching the tube, Elaine is flipping through the channels constantly.|ELAINE|We, there are always a few.
While Jerry and Elaine are sitting on Jerry's couch watching the tube, Elaine is flipping through the channels constantly.|JERRY|I mean, if anything happened, and we couldn't be friends the way we are now, that would be really bad.
While Jerry and Elaine are sitting on Jerry's couch watching the tube, Elaine is flipping through the channels constantly.|ELAINE|Devastating.
While Jerry and Elaine are sitting on Jerry's couch watching the tube, Elaine is flipping through the channels constantly.|JERRY|Because this is very good. (Points back and forth between them to indicate friendship)
While Jerry and Elaine are sitting on Jerry's couch watching the tube, Elaine is flipping through the channels constantly.|ELAINE|And that would be good. (Points to bedroom)
While Jerry and Elaine are sitting on Jerry's couch watching the tube, Elaine is flipping through the channels constantly.|JERRY|That would be good too. The idea is combine the this and the that. But this cannot be disturbed.
While Jerry and Elaine are sitting on Jerry's couch watching the tube, Elaine is flipping through the channels constantly.|ELAINE|Yeah, we just wanna take this and add that.
While Jerry and Elaine are sitting on Jerry's couch watching the tube, Elaine is flipping through the channels constantly.|JERRY|But of course, we'd have to figure out a way to avoid the things that cause the little problems. Maybe some rules or something.
While Jerry and Elaine are sitting on Jerry's couch watching the tube, Elaine is flipping through the channels constantly.|ELAINE|Huh.
While Jerry and Elaine are sitting on Jerry's couch watching the tube, Elaine is flipping through the channels constantly.|JERRY|For example, now, I call you whenever I'm inclined and vice versa.
While Jerry and Elaine are sitting on Jerry's couch watching the tube, Elaine is flipping through the channels constantly.|ELAINE|Right.
While Jerry and Elaine are sitting on Jerry's couch watching the tube, Elaine is flipping through the channels constantly.|JERRY|But if we did that, we might feel a certain obligation to call.
While Jerry and Elaine are sitting on Jerry's couch watching the tube, Elaine is flipping through the channels constantly.|ELAINE|Well why should that be? Oh, I have an idea. I have an idea. No call the day after that.
While Jerry and Elaine are sitting on Jerry's couch watching the tube, Elaine is flipping through the channels constantly.|JERRY|Beautiful. Let's make it a rule.
While Jerry and Elaine are sitting on Jerry's couch watching the tube, Elaine is flipping through the channels constantly.|ELAINE|All right, sir.
While Jerry and Elaine are sitting on Jerry's couch watching the tube, Elaine is flipping through the channels constantly.|JERRY|Now here's another little rule.
While Jerry and Elaine are sitting on Jerry's couch watching the tube, Elaine is flipping through the channels constantly.|ELAINE|Yeah.
While Jerry and Elaine are sitting on Jerry's couch watching the tube, Elaine is flipping through the channels constantly.|JERRY|When we see each other now, we retire to our separate quarters. But sometimes, when people get involved with that, they feel pressure to sleep over. When that is not really sleep. Sleep is separate from that. And I don't see why sleep got all tied up and connected with that.
While Jerry and Elaine are sitting on Jerry's couch watching the tube, Elaine is flipping through the channels constantly.|ELAINE|Okay, okay. Rule Number Two. Spending the night is optional!
While Jerry and Elaine are sitting on Jerry's couch watching the tube, Elaine is flipping through the channels constantly.|JERRY|Well now we're gettin' somewhere.
While Jerry and Elaine are sitting on Jerry's couch watching the tube, Elaine is flipping through the channels constantly.|ELAINE|What about the kiss goodnight?
While Jerry and Elaine are sitting on Jerry's couch watching the tube, Elaine is flipping through the channels constantly.|JERRY|Tough one. You're call.
While Jerry and Elaine are sitting on Jerry's couch watching the tube, Elaine is flipping through the channels constantly.|ELAINE|It's brug-wa (?).
While Jerry and Elaine are sitting on Jerry's couch watching the tube, Elaine is flipping through the channels constantly.|JERRY|Fine. Well.
While Jerry and Elaine are sitting on Jerry's couch watching the tube, Elaine is flipping through the channels constantly.|ELAINE|Well.
While Jerry and Elaine are sitting on Jerry's couch watching the tube, Elaine is flipping through the channels constantly.|JERRY|You ready?
While Jerry and Elaine are sitting on Jerry's couch watching the tube, Elaine is flipping through the channels constantly.|ELAINE|Ready.
While Jerry and Elaine are sitting on Jerry's couch watching the tube, Elaine is flipping through the channels constantly.|JERRY|So think you can handle this?
While Jerry and Elaine are sitting on Jerry's couch watching the tube, Elaine is flipping through the channels constantly.|ELAINE|Definitely. (Runs into bookshelf)
Jerry's apartment the next day. Kramer enters.|KRAMER|Hey.
Jerry's apartment the next day. Kramer enters.|JERRY|Hey.
Jerry's apartment the next day. Kramer enters.|KRAMER|Got the paper?
Jerry's apartment the next day. Kramer enters.|JERRY|Not yet.
Jerry's apartment the next day. Kramer enters.|KRAMER|No paper?
Jerry's apartment the next day. Kramer enters.|JERRY|I haven't been out yet.
Jerry's apartment the next day. Kramer enters.|KRAMER|Well, what's taking you so long? (Elaine enters from the bedroom. Kramer is a little shocked) Uh? Oh, well, yeah... (He exits)
George and Jerry at Monk's.|GEORGE|What's the deal with Aquaman? Could he go on land, or was he just restricted to water?
George and Jerry at Monk's.|JERRY|No, I think I saw him on land a couple times. So how's the job situation goin'?
George and Jerry at Monk's.|GEORGE|Still lookin'. It's pretty bad out there. What about you?
George and Jerry at Monk's.|JERRY|Nothin' much. I slept with Elaine last night.
George and Jerry at Monk's.|GEORGE|Oxygen! I need some oxygen! This is major.
George and Jerry at Monk's.|JERRY|I thought you'd like that.
George and Jerry at Monk's.|GEORGE|Oh, this is huge!
George and Jerry at Monk's.|JERRY|I know.
George and Jerry at Monk's.|GEORGE|All right, okay. Let's go, details.
George and Jerry at Monk's.|JERRY|No, I can't do details.
George and Jerry at Monk's.|GEORGE|You wha?
George and Jerry at Monk's.|JERRY|I can't give details.
George and Jerry at Monk's.|GEORGE|No details?
George and Jerry at Monk's.|JERRY|I'm not in the mood.
George and Jerry at Monk's.|GEORGE|You ask me here to have lunch, tell me you slept with Elaine, and then say you're not in the mood for details. Now you listen to me. I want details and I want them right now. I don't have a job, I have no place to go. You're not in the mood? Well you get in the mood!
George and Jerry at Monk's.|JERRY|All right, okay. We're in the apartment watching TV.
George and Jerry at Monk's.|GEORGE|Where are you sitting?
George and Jerry at Monk's.|JERRY|On the couch.
George and Jerry at Monk's.|GEORGE|Next to each other?
George and Jerry at Monk's.|JERRY|No, separated.
George and Jerry at Monk's.|GEORGE|Time?
George and Jerry at Monk's.|JERRY|Around eleven.
George and Jerry at Monk's.|GEORGE|Okay, go ahead.
George and Jerry at Monk's.|JERRY|So she's flipping around the TV, and she gets to the naked station.
George and Jerry at Monk's.|GEORGE|Oh, see? that's why I don't have cable in my house. Because of that naked station. If I had that in my house, I would never turn it off. I wouldn't sleep, I wouldn't eat. Eventually, firemen would have to break through the door, they'd find me sitting there in my pajamas with drool coming down my face. All right, all right. So you're watching the naked station.
George and Jerry at Monk's.|JERRY|And then, somehow, we started talking about, what if we had sex.
George and Jerry at Monk's.|GEORGE|Boy, these are really bad details.
George and Jerry at Monk's.|JERRY|It pains me to say this, but I may be getting to mature for details.
George and Jerry at Monk's.|GEORGE|Oh I hate to hear this. That kind of growth really irritates me.
George and Jerry at Monk's.|JERRY|Well. I'll tell you though. It was really passionate.
George and Jerry at Monk's.|GEORGE|Better than before?
George and Jerry at Monk's.|JERRY|She must've taken some kind of seminar or something.
George and Jerry at Monk's.|GEORGE|This is all too much. So what are you feeling? What's going on? Are you like a couple again now?
George and Jerry at Monk's.|JERRY|Not exactly.
George and Jerry at Monk's.|GEORGE|Not exactly. What does that mean?
George and Jerry at Monk's.|JERRY|Well, we've tried to arrange a situation where we'll be able to do this once in a while and still be friends. (George laughs hysterically and stands out of his seat)
George and Jerry at Monk's.|GEORGE|Where are you living? Are you here? Are you on this planet? It's impossible. It can't be done.
George and Jerry at Monk's.|JERRY|I think we've worked out a system.
George and Jerry at Monk's.|GEORGE|Oh, you know what you're like? You're like a pathetic gambler. You're one of those losers in Las Vegas who keeps thinking he's gonna come up with a way to win at blackjack.
George and Jerry at Monk's.|JERRY|No, this is very advanced. We've designed at set of rules that we can maintain the friendship by avoiding all of the relationship pitfalls.
George and Jerry at Monk's.|GEORGE|Sure, all right. Tell me the rules.
George and Jerry at Monk's.|JERRY|Okay. No calls the next day.
George and Jerry at Monk's.|GEORGE|(To himself) So you're havin' the sex, next day you don't have to call. That's pretty good. (Back to Jerry) Go ahead.
George and Jerry at Monk's.|JERRY|You ready for the second one?
George and Jerry at Monk's.|GEORGE|I have tell you, I'm pretty impressed with the first one.
George and Jerry at Monk's.|JERRY|Spending the night. Optional.
George and Jerry at Monk's.|GEORGE|No, you see? You got greedy.
George and Jerry at Monk's.|JERRY|No, that's the rule. It's optional.
George and Jerry at Monk's.|GEORGE|I know less about women than anyone in the world. But one thing I do know is they're not happy if you don't spend the night. It could be a hot, sweaty room with no air conditioning and all they have is a little army cot this wide (Displays with French fry) You're not going anywhere.
George and Jerry at Monk's.|JERRY|I think you're wrong.
George and Jerry at Monk's.|GEORGE|I hope I am.

Jerry and George are at the store.|GEORGE|Maybe I'll get her some jewelry.

Jerry and George are at the store.|GEORGE|What am I supposed to get, a bazooka?

Jerry and Elaine sitting on his couch. Elaine holding a present.|JERRY|(Starts to correct then realizes) Well...
Jerry and George at Monk's.|GEORGE|Those birthdays. I told you. They're relationship killers. If a relationship is having any problems whatsoever, a birthday will always bring it out.
Jerry and George at Monk's.|JERRY|I never should have made up those rules.
Jerry and George at Monk's.|GEORGE|What is it about sex that just disrupts everything? Is it the touching? Is it the nudity?
Jerry and George at Monk's.|JERRY|It can't be the nudity. I never got into these terrible fights and misunderstandings when I was changing before gym class.
Jerry and George at Monk's.|GEORGE|You know what this means? I can't see her anymore either.
Jerry and George at Monk's.|JERRY|Why?
Jerry and George at Monk's.|GEORGE|It's break up by association. Besides, she's mad at me anyway because of my birthday present.
Jerry and George at Monk's.|JERRY|What did you end up giving her?
Jerry and George at Monk's.|GEORGE|91 dollars.
Jerry and George at Monk's.|JERRY|Sorry about that.
Jerry and George at Monk's.|GEORGE|So what're you gonna do?
Jerry and George at Monk's.|JERRY|Well, if I call her, there's no joking around anymore. This is pretty much it.
Jerry and George at Monk's.|GEORGE|So, maybe this should be it.
Jerry and George at Monk's.|JERRY|Could be it.
Jerry and George at Monk's.|GEORGE|She seems like an it.
Jerry and George at Monk's.|JERRY|She's at it as you get. Imagine bumping into her on the street in five years with a husband. And she tells me he's a sculptor, they live in Vermont...
Jerry and George at Monk's.|GEORGE|We'd have to kill him.
Jerry and George at Monk's.|JERRY|We'd get caught, I'd get the chair.
Jerry and George at Monk's.|GEORGE|I'd go to prison as your accomplice. I'd have to wear that really heavy denim. Go to the cafeteria line with the guy who slops those mashed potatoes onto your plate. Go to the bathroom in front of hundreds of people.
Jerry and George at Monk's.|JERRY|Plus, you know what else.
Jerry and George at Monk's.|GEORGE|You better call her.
