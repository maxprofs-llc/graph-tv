opening monologue; first sentence kinda blurry|JERRY|(A couple of days ago I used a public phone), go over time on the call, hang up the phone, walk away. You've had this happen? Phone rings. It's the phone company... they want more money. Don't you love this? And you got them right where you want them for the first time in your life. You're on the street, there's nothing they can do. I like to let it ring a few times, you know, let her sweat a little over there, then I just pick it up, "Yeah, operator... oh, I got the money... I got the money right here... D'you hear that? (taps on microphone) That's a quarter. Yeah, you want that don't you?"
Jerry, Elaine & George enter the Chinese restaurant|ELAINE|No, they've just got to get more cops on the force, it's as simple as that.
Jerry, Elaine & George enter the Chinese restaurant|GEORGE|Cops. I don't even care about cops. I wanna see more garbage men. It's much more important. All I wanna see are garbage trucks, garbage cans and garbage men. You're never gonna stop crime, we should at least be clean.
Jerry, Elaine & George enter the Chinese restaurant|JERRY|I tell you what they should do, they should combine the two jobs, make it one job, 'cop\garbage man'. I always see cops walking around with nothing to do. Grab a broom! Start sweeping. You sweep sweep sweep... catch a criminal, get right back to sweeping.
Jerry, Elaine & George enter the Chinese restaurant|ELAINE|You should run for mayor.
Jerry, Elaine & George enter the Chinese restaurant|JERRY|Ehh, nobody listens.
Jerry, Elaine & George enter the Chinese restaurant|ELAINE|Where is someone? I'm starving.
Jerry, Elaine & George enter the Chinese restaurant|GEORGE|I think this is him right here.
Jerry, Elaine & George enter the Chinese restaurant|ELAINE|Is there a table ready?
Jerry, Elaine & George enter the Chinese restaurant|GEORGE|I don't know, I have to call her, tell her where we are. I'm very lucky she's even considering seeing me at all.
Jerry, Elaine & George enter the Chinese restaurant|JERRY|Really? I thought things were going OK.
Jerry, Elaine & George enter the Chinese restaurant|GEORGE|They were, it's kinda complicated.
Jerry, Elaine & George enter the Chinese restaurant|JERRY|Well what is it?

Jerry, Elaine & George enter the Chinese restaurant|ELAINE|Jerry, get menus so when we sit down we can order right away.
Jerry, Elaine & George enter the Chinese restaurant|JERRY|Can't look at a menu now, I gotta be at the table.
Jerry, Elaine & George enter the Chinese restaurant|GEORGE|He knows I'm waiting. He sees me. He just doesn't wanna look.
Jerry, Elaine & George enter the Chinese restaurant|ELAINE|Everything's gotta be just so with you, doesn't it?
Jerry, Elaine & George enter the Chinese restaurant|JERRY|Hey, I offered you those cookies in my house.
Jerry, Elaine & George enter the Chinese restaurant|ELAINE|Health cookies. I hate those little dustboard fructose things.
Jerry, Elaine & George enter the Chinese restaurant|GEORGE|I just can't believe at the way people are. What is it with humanity? What kind of a world do we live in?
Jerry, Elaine & George enter the Chinese restaurant|action|Jerry stares at someone
Jerry, Elaine & George enter the Chinese restaurant|ELAINE|What?

Jerry, Elaine & George enter the Chinese restaurant|BRUCE|No, no, they were here before. Keckitch(sp?), 2!
Jerry, Elaine & George enter the Chinese restaurant|ELAINE|Did you ever notice how happy people are when they finally get a table? They think they're so special because they've been chosen. It's enough to make you sick.
Jerry, Elaine & George enter the Chinese restaurant|JERRY|Boy, you are really hungry.
Jerry, Elaine & George enter the Chinese restaurant|action|guy on phone smiles at him and turns back. George, annoyed, goes over to Jerry
Jerry, Elaine & George enter the Chinese restaurant|GEORGE|If anything happens here, can I count on you?

Jerry, Elaine & George enter the Chinese restaurant|ELAINE|Ya know, its not fair people are seated First Come First Served, It should be based on who's hungriest. I feel like just going over there and taking some food off somebody's plate.
Jerry, Elaine & George enter the Chinese restaurant|JERRY|I'll tell you what, there's 50 bucks in it for you if you do it.
Jerry, Elaine & George enter the Chinese restaurant|ELAINE|What do you mean?
Jerry, Elaine & George enter the Chinese restaurant|JERRY|You walk over that table, you pick up an eggroll, you don't say anything, you eat it, say 'thank you very much', wipe your mouth, walk away- I give you 50 bucks.
Jerry, Elaine & George enter the Chinese restaurant|GEORGE|What are they gonna do?
Jerry, Elaine & George enter the Chinese restaurant|JERRY|They won't do anything; in fact, you'll be giving them a story to tell for the rest of their lives.
Jerry, Elaine & George enter the Chinese restaurant|ELAINE|50 bucks, you'll give me 50 bucks?
Jerry, Elaine & George enter the Chinese restaurant|JERRY|50 bucks. That table over there, the three couples.
Jerry, Elaine & George enter the Chinese restaurant|ELAINE|OK, I don't wanna go over there and do it, and then come back here and find out there was some little loophole, like I didn't put mustard on it or something...
Jerry, Elaine & George enter the Chinese restaurant|JERRY|No, no tricks.
Jerry, Elaine & George enter the Chinese restaurant|ELAINE|Should I do it, George?
Jerry, Elaine & George enter the Chinese restaurant|GEORGE|For 50 bucks? I'd put my face in the soup and blow.

Jerry, Elaine & George enter the Chinese restaurant|WOMAN|Well I won't be long.
Jerry, Elaine & George enter the Chinese restaurant|GEORGE|That's not the point. The point is I was here first.
Jerry, Elaine & George enter the Chinese restaurant|WOMAN|Well if you were here first, you'd be holding the phone.
Jerry, Elaine & George enter the Chinese restaurant|action|he goes over to Jerry and Elaine
Jerry, Elaine & George enter the Chinese restaurant|GEORGE|Does she care? No. Does anyone ever display the slightest sensitivity over the problems of a fellow individual? No. No. A resounding no!

Jerry, Elaine & George enter the Chinese restaurant|GUY|Hey, sorry I took so long.
Jerry, Elaine & George enter the Chinese restaurant|GEORGE|Oh that's OK, really, don't worry about it.
Jerry, Elaine & George enter the Chinese restaurant|ELAINE|How do people fast? Did Ghandi get this crazy? I'm gonna walk around, see what dishes look good.
Jerry, Elaine & George enter the Chinese restaurant|JERRY|I told my uncle I had a stomach ache tonight. You think he bought that?
Jerry, Elaine & George enter the Chinese restaurant|GEORGE|Yeah, well, he probably bought it.
Jerry, Elaine & George enter the Chinese restaurant|JERRY|So what happened with Tatiana?
Jerry, Elaine & George enter the Chinese restaurant|GEORGE|I shouldn't even tell you this.
Jerry, Elaine & George enter the Chinese restaurant|JERRY|Come on...
Jerry, Elaine & George enter the Chinese restaurant|GEORGE|Well, after dinner last week, she invites me back to her apartment.
Jerry, Elaine & George enter the Chinese restaurant|JERRY|I'm with you.
Jerry, Elaine & George enter the Chinese restaurant|GEORGE|Well, it's this little place with this little bathroom. It's like right there, you know, it's not even down a little hall or off in an alcove. You understand? There's no... buffer zone. So, we start to fool around, and it's the first time, and it's early in the going. And I begin to perceive this impending... intestinal requirement, whose needs are going to surpass by great lengths anything in the sexual realm. So I know I'm gonna have to stop. And as this is happening I'm thinking, even if I can somehow manage to momentarily... extricate myself from the proceedings and relieve this unstoppable force, I know that that bathroom is not gonna provide me with the privacy that I know I'm going to need...
Jerry, Elaine & George enter the Chinese restaurant|JERRY|This could only happen to you.
Jerry, Elaine & George enter the Chinese restaurant|GEORGE|So I finally stop and say, "Tatiana, I hope you don't take this the wrong way, but I think it would be best if I left".
Jerry, Elaine & George enter the Chinese restaurant|JERRY|You said this to her after.
Jerry, Elaine & George enter the Chinese restaurant|GEORGE|No. During.
Jerry, Elaine & George enter the Chinese restaurant|JERRY|Oh, boy.
Jerry, Elaine & George enter the Chinese restaurant|GEORGE|Yeah.
Jerry, Elaine & George enter the Chinese restaurant|JERRY|Wow! So...?
Jerry, Elaine & George enter the Chinese restaurant|GEORGE|So I'm dressing and she's staring up at me, struggling to compute this unprecedented turn of events. I don't know what to say to reassure this woman, and worst of all, I don't have the time to say it. The only excuse she might possibly have accepted is if I told her I am in reality Batman, and I'm very sorry, I just saw the Bat-Signal. It took me 3 days of phone calls to get her to agree to see me again. Now she's waiting for me to call her, and she's
Jerry, Elaine & George enter the Chinese restaurant|action|Elaine comes over
Jerry, Elaine & George enter the Chinese restaurant|ELAINE|I hate this place. I don't know why we came here, I'm never coming back here again.
Jerry, Elaine & George enter the Chinese restaurant|ELAINE|Remember when you first went out to eat with your parents? Remember, it was such a treat to go and they serve you this different food that you never saw before, and they put it in front of you, and it is such a delicious and exciting adventure? And now I just feel like a big sweaty hog waiting for them to fill up the trough.
Jerry, Elaine & George enter the Chinese restaurant|GEORGE|She's off. (goes over to the now available public phone)
Jerry, Elaine & George enter the Chinese restaurant|ELAINE|Jerry, talk to that guy again.
Jerry, Elaine & George enter the Chinese restaurant|JERRY|What am I gonna say?

Jerry, Elaine & George enter the Chinese restaurant|ELAINE|He's always here? What does that mean? What does that mean?
Jerry, Elaine & George enter the Chinese restaurant|BRUCE|Oh, Mr. Cohen, very nice man. He live on Park Avenue.
Jerry, Elaine & George enter the Chinese restaurant|ELAINE|Where am I? Is this a dream? What in God's name is going on here?!
Jerry, Elaine & George enter the Chinese restaurant|GEORGE|She's not there. She left. She must've waited and left because those people wouldn't get off the phone.
Jerry, Elaine & George enter the Chinese restaurant|JERRY|Didja leave a message?
Jerry, Elaine & George enter the Chinese restaurant|GEORGE|Yeah, I told her to call me here and to tell anyone who answers the phone to ask for a balding, stocky man with glasses. I better tell him I'm expecting a call.
Jerry, Elaine & George enter the Chinese restaurant|ELAINE|Oh, Jerry, here comes that woman...
Jerry, Elaine & George enter the Chinese restaurant|JERRY|Where do I know her?

He's gonna tell his wife, his wife's gonna call my mother. Oh, this is bad, you don't know, the chain reaction of calls this is gonna set off.

Jerry, Elaine & George enter the Chinese restaurant|JERRY|...My uncle to my cousin, my cousin to my sister, my sister to me.
Jerry, Elaine & George enter the Chinese restaurant|ELAINE|You should've just had dinner with your uncle tonight and gotten in over with. It's just a movie.
Jerry, Elaine & George enter the Chinese restaurant|JERRY|Just a movie?! You don't understand. This isn't 'Plans 1 through 8 from Outer Space', this is 'Plan 9', this is the one that worked. The worst movie ever made!
Jerry, Elaine & George enter the Chinese restaurant|action|Elaine nods
Jerry, Elaine & George enter the Chinese restaurant|JERRY|Hey, I got news for you, if we're making this movie, we gotta get a table immediately.
Jerry, Elaine & George enter the Chinese restaurant|ELAINE|Alright, OK. Let's stop fooling around. Let's just slip him some money.
Jerry, Elaine & George enter the Chinese restaurant|JERRY|In a Chinese restaurant? Do they take money?
Jerry, Elaine & George enter the Chinese restaurant|ELAINE|Do they take money? Everyone takes money. I used to go out with a guy who did it all the time, you just slip him 20 bucks.
Jerry, Elaine & George enter the Chinese restaurant|GEORGE|20 bucks? Isn't that excessive?
Jerry, Elaine & George enter the Chinese restaurant|ELAINE|Well what do you want to give him, change?
Jerry, Elaine & George enter the Chinese restaurant|GEORGE|It's more than the meal!
Jerry, Elaine & George enter the Chinese restaurant|JERRY|Oh, come on, We'll divide it up three ways.
Jerry, Elaine & George enter the Chinese restaurant|GEORGE|Alright. 7,7, (points at himself) 6. I'm not gonna eat that much!
Jerry, Elaine & George enter the Chinese restaurant|JERRY|I'm counting your shrimps. OK, Who's gonna do it?
Jerry, Elaine & George enter the Chinese restaurant|GEORGE|Oh no, I can't do it. I-I'm not good at these things, I get flustered. Once I tried to bribe an usher at the roller derby, I almost got arrested.
Jerry, Elaine & George enter the Chinese restaurant|ELAINE|I guess it's you, Jer.
Jerry, Elaine & George enter the Chinese restaurant|JERRY|Me? What about you?
Jerry, Elaine & George enter the Chinese restaurant|ELAINE|Oh, I can't do that, it's a guy thing.
Jerry, Elaine & George enter the Chinese restaurant|JERRY|The woman's movement just can't seem to make any progress in the world of bribery, can they?
Jerry, Elaine & George enter the Chinese restaurant|ELAINE|Give me the money.
Jerry, Elaine & George enter the Chinese restaurant|action|Elaine stands close to Bruce, trying to get his attention

Jerry, Elaine & George enter the Chinese restaurant|JERRY|Well, actually, we did date for a while, but... it's really not relevant here.
Jerry, Elaine & George enter the Chinese restaurant|BRUCE|Relationships are difficult. It's very hard to stay together-
Jerry, Elaine & George enter the Chinese restaurant|JERRY|Alright, listen, alright. How much longer is it gonna be?
Jerry, Elaine & George enter the Chinese restaurant|BRUCE|Oh. In about five, ten minutes.
Jerry, Elaine & George enter the Chinese restaurant|action|Jerry goes over to Elaine and George
Jerry, Elaine & George enter the Chinese restaurant|GEORGE|So?
Jerry, Elaine & George enter the Chinese restaurant|JERRY|There seems to be a bit of a discrepancy.
Jerry, Elaine & George enter the Chinese restaurant|ELAINE|So when are we gonna eat?

Jerry, Elaine & George enter the Chinese restaurant|ELAINE|I say we leave now, we go to 'Skyburger' and we scarf 'em down.
Jerry, Elaine & George enter the Chinese restaurant|JERRY|I'm not going to 'Skyburger'. Besides, it's in the opposite direction, let's just eat popcorn or something.
Jerry, Elaine & George enter the Chinese restaurant|ELAINE|I can't have popcorn for dinner!
Jerry, Elaine & George enter the Chinese restaurant|BRUCE|Cartwright?
Jerry, Elaine & George enter the Chinese restaurant|JERRY|So they have hotdogs there.
Jerry, Elaine & George enter the Chinese restaurant|ELAINE|Oh, movie hotdogs! I rather lick the food off the floor.

Jerry, Elaine & George enter the Chinese restaurant|JERRY|So You're not going?
Jerry, Elaine & George enter the Chinese restaurant|ELAINE|You don't need us.
Jerry, Elaine & George enter the Chinese restaurant|JERRY|Well I can't go to a bad movie by myself. Who am I gonna make sarcastic remarks to, strangers? Eh, I guess I'll just go to my uncle's.
Jerry, Elaine & George enter the Chinese restaurant|GEORGE|Should we tell him we're leaving?
Jerry, Elaine & George enter the Chinese restaurant|ELAINE|What for? Let's just get out of here.
Jerry, Elaine & George enter the Chinese restaurant|action|they all leave
Jerry, Elaine & George enter the Chinese restaurant|BRUCE|Seinfeld, 4?
closing monologue|JERRY|Hunger will make people do amazing things. I mean, the proof of that is cannibalism. Cannibalism, what do they say, I mean, they're eating and, you know, "This is good, who is this? I like this person". You know, I mean, I would think the hardest thing about being a cannibal is trying to get some very deep sleep, you know what I mean? I would think, you'd be like, (pretending to wake up) "Who is that? Who's there? Who's there? Is somebody there? What do you want? What do you want? You look hungry, are you hungry? Get out of here!"
