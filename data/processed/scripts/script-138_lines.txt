Jerry and Kramer walking down the street. Jerry is closest to the street.|JERRY|What about over there? You know air conditioners fall out all the time.
Jerry and Kramer walking down the street. Jerry is closest to the street.|KRAMER|I'd much rather get hit by an 80 pound air conditioner than a two ton cab.
Jerry and Kramer walking down the street. Jerry is closest to the street.|JERRY|No, cab's comin' in right here (Hand at waist) Set of plastic hips, prosthetic legs, and a monkey to answer the door, I'm back in business.

Jerry's apartment, Kramer enters|KRAMER|Death Blow: When someone tries to blow you up, not because of who you are, but for different reasons altogether. (Jerry buzzes up George) Jerry, do you think you can get an extra ticket for my friend Brody?
Jerry's apartment, Kramer enters|JERRY|Kramer, do you know what I had to go through to get these?
Jerry's apartment, Kramer enters|KRAMER|Yeah, I know, but he's a big fan of the genre. You know I'd consider it a personal favor to me.
Kramer is eating ice cream right out of the container.|JERRY|Yeah I guess I do owe you.
Kramer is eating ice cream right out of the container.|KRAMER|Uh, listen, do you want me to stay here until George gets up?
Kramer is eating ice cream right out of the container.|JERRY|No, I'm okay.
Kramer is eating ice cream right out of the container.|KRAMER|There's no problem, really.
Kramer is eating ice cream right out of the container.|JERRY|I'm fine. (George enters, Kramer exits) How was the party?
Kramer is eating ice cream right out of the container.|GEORGE|Food was good.
Kramer is eating ice cream right out of the container.|JERRY|Yeah, so I didn't miss anything?
Kramer is eating ice cream right out of the container.|GEORGE|Well, actually you did miss one nugget of entertainment. (Pause) Have you ever seen Elaine dance?
Kramer is eating ice cream right out of the container.|JERRY|Elaine danced?
Kramer is eating ice cream right out of the container.|GEORGE|It was more like a full bodied dry heave set to music.
Kramer is eating ice cream right out of the container.|JERRY|Did she do the little kicks and the thumbs?
Kramer is eating ice cream right out of the container.|GEORGE|What, you mean you know about this?
Kramer is eating ice cream right out of the container.|JERRY|For some time... (video of Elaine dancing on the street with Jerry and the street musicians watching her awful dance) It was about five years ago. I never knew what to say to her about it. It was one of those problems I hoped would just go away.
Kramer is eating ice cream right out of the container.|GEORGE|Well, sometimes you can't help these people 'til they hit rock bottom.
Kramer is eating ice cream right out of the container.|JERRY|And by then you've lost interest.
Kramer is eating ice cream right out of the container.|GEORGE|Hey, you gotta take a ride with me later. I borrowed my father's car. '68 GTO.
Kramer is eating ice cream right out of the container.|JERRY|What made him get that thing?
Kramer is eating ice cream right out of the container.|GEORGE|During that period when my folks were separated he went a little crazy.
Kramer is eating ice cream right out of the container.|JERRY|Not a very long trip. (Enter Kramer)
Kramer is eating ice cream right out of the container.|KRAMER|Brody's in.
Kramer is eating ice cream right out of the container.|JERRY|I don't even have the extra ticket yet.
Kramer is eating ice cream right out of the container.|KRAMER|Well, you better get on the horn.
Elaine's office, Elaine on the phone|ELAINE|I'm tellin' you Jerry I'm gettin' a vibe. If I didn't know better, I'd say the staff completely lost respect for me. (Staff mocks her dancing in the background)
Elaine's office, Elaine on the phone|JERRY|How could that be?
Elaine's office, Elaine on the phone|ELAINE|Jerry, it's like the feeling is palpable. You think it could have something to do with the party?
Elaine's office, Elaine on the phone|JERRY|No, George was there, he said he had a great time.
Elaine's office, Elaine on the phone|ELAINE|Ah, it's George. I bet you this is somehow George related.
Elaine's office, Elaine on the phone|JERRY|Oh, what are you talkin' about?
Elaine's office, Elaine on the phone|ELAINE|He's like a virus. He attaches himself to a healthy host company, and the next thing you know, the entire staff's infected.
Elaine's office, Elaine on the phone|JERRY|Now you're talkin' crazy!
Elaine's office, Elaine on the phone|ELAINE|All right, Jerry, if that's not what it is, you tell me. What is it?
Elaine's office, Elaine on the phone|JERRY|(Makes sound) Oh there's my call waiting, I gotta get goin'.
Elaine's office, Anna enters|ANNA|You have a minute to approve some copy?
Elaine's office, Anna enters|ELAINE|Oh yeah, sure, sure. So ah, did ya have a good time at the party last night?
Elaine's office, Anna enters|ANNA|It was a real... kick.
Elaine's office, Anna enters|ELAINE|Hey, did you happen to speak to my friend George?
Elaine's office, Anna enters|ANNA|As a matter of fact I did.
Elaine's office, Anna enters|ELAINE|Ah hah. Well, listen. You would be wise to keep your distance from him.
Elaine's office, Anna enters|ANNA|Why? He seems harmless.
Elaine's office, Anna enters|ELAINE|Oh he's not. He's very harmful.
Elaine's office, Anna enters|ANNA|Really?
Elaine's office, Anna enters|ELAINE|Oh trust me. He's a bad seed. He's a horrible seed. He's one of the worst seeds I've ever seen.
Elaine's office, Anna enters|ANNA|And you two are friends?
Elaine's office, Anna enters|ELAINE|Yeah, we're good friends.
Coffee shop|GEORGE|So this Anna called me from out of the blue.
Coffee shop|JERRY|Really? I thought you were rebuffed.
Coffee shop|GEORGE|With extreme prejudice.
Coffee shop|JERRY|Maybe Elaine put in a good word for you.
Coffee shop|GEORGE|No, no. That's just the thing. Anna told me that Elaine said I was one of the worst seeds she'd ever seen.
Coffee shop|JERRY|Interesting. She doesn't care for you, then a stern warning, suddenly a phone call. Seems Elaine's made you the bad boy. And Anna digs the bad boy.
Coffee shop|GEORGE|I'm the bad boy. I've never been the bad boy.
Coffee shop|JERRY|You've been the bad employee, the bad son, the bad friend...
Coffee shop|GEORGE|Yes ... yes, yes
Coffee shop|JERRY|The bad fianc√©&Mac226;, the bad dinner guest, the bad credit risk...
Coffee shop|GEORGE|Okay, the point is made.
Coffee shop|JERRY|The bad date, the bad sport, the bad citizen... (looks at table as George exits) The bad tipper!

At the movies...|BRODY|It's for all of us. Is there a problem?
At the movies...|KRAMER|Brody, c'mon. He's just kidding. He's a joke maker. Tell him, Jerry.
At the movies...|JERRY|I'm a joke maker.
At the movies...|KRAMER|All right, here we go, Death Blow. (Brody takes out video camera)
At the movies...|JERRY|(To Kramer) Hey, hey, what the hell is he doing?
At the movies...|KRAMER|Relax, he does that all the time.
At the movies...|JERRY|Does what?

Anna and George in the park.|ANNA|You know I'm not supposed to be talking to you.
Anna and George in the park.|GEORGE|No one's putting a gun to your head. Do I, uh, scare you?
Anna and George in the park.|ANNA|No... a little. Nice car.
Anna and George in the park.|GEORGE|Yeah, she's a sweet ride.
Anna and George in the park.|ANNA|Is that your orthopedic back pillow?
Anna and George in the park.|GEORGE|Maybe.
Anna and George in the park.|ANNA|Well is it or isn't it?
Anna and George in the park.|GEORGE|Guess not.
Anna and George in the park.|action|Elaine arrives.
Anna and George in the park.|ELAINE|(To George) Stay away from her.
Anna and George in the park.|GEORGE|I didn't do nothin'.
Anna and George in the park.|ELAINE|(To Anna) Get in the car.
Anna and George in the park.|ANNA|But...
Anna and George in the park.|ELAINE|You heard me young lady, get in the car. (To George) And you, you should know better. I don't want you infecting my staff.

Death Blow...|action|Movie Voice: So Death Blow, we meet again ...
Death Blow...|BRODY|Uh, I got a cramp.

Death Blow...|BRODY|Uh, there it goes again. Kramer, you gotta drive me home.
Death Blow...|JERRY|Hey, what is going on over there?
Death Blow...|BRODY|Jerry, finish shooting the movie for me.
Death Blow...|JERRY|Are you nuts? There's no way I'm holding that thing.
Death Blow...|KRAMER|Jerry, if the man is in pain...
Death Blow...|JERRY|Yeah well, maybe if he didn't lick his fingers before he reached in the bag we would've eaten some. Serves him right.
Death Blow...|BRODY|(pulls out a gun) What are you some kind of tough guy?
Death Blow...|KRAMER|Okay. Let's everybody just relax. Jerry, take the camera.
Death Blow...|JERRY|All right, I'm, i,m takin' the camera.
Death Blow...|KRAMER|(To Brody) C'mon, let's go.
Death Blow...|JERRY|Oh man...
Jerry's apartment, Kramer enters.|KRAMER|Hey man, so how was the rest of Death Blow?
Jerry's apartment, Kramer enters.|JERRY|How was the rest of Death Blow?
Jerry's apartment, Kramer enters.|KRAMER|Yeah, who got the final Death Blow, 'cause I thought that Hawaiian guy, he had it comin' to him!
Jerry's apartment, Kramer enters.|JERRY|Kramer, you make me get a ticket for this friend of yours and then the guy forces me to bootleg the movie at gun point!
Jerry's apartment, Kramer enters.|KRAMER|He's quite a character, isn't he?
Jerry's apartment, Kramer enters.|JERRY|You know, he came by here at 3 o'clock in the morning to pick up the tape. I was scared out of my mind!
Jerry's apartment, Kramer enters.|action|buzzer
Jerry's apartment, Kramer enters.|KRAMER|I got it. Yep.

Jerry's apartment, Kramer enters.|KRAMER|Come on up. It's Brody.
Jerry's apartment, Kramer enters.|JERRY|What are you, crazy? I don't want to see this guy again.
Jerry's apartment, Kramer enters.|KRAMER|Jerry, you did him a favor. He probably wants to come up and thank you.
Jerry's apartment, Kramer enters.|JERRY|What if I didn't do it right?
Jerry's apartment, Kramer enters.|KRAMER|It's your first time. He'll understand.
Jerry's apartment, Kramer enters.|JERRY|People with guns don't understand. That's why they get guns. Too many misunderstandings.
Jerry's apartment, Kramer enters.|action|Brody enters
Jerry's apartment, Kramer enters.|KRAMER|Hey, Brody!
Jerry's apartment, Kramer enters.|JERRY|Hi.
Jerry's apartment, Kramer enters.|BRODY|Jerry, I have to talk to you about the tape.
Jerry's apartment, Kramer enters.|JERRY|Yeah.
Jerry's apartment, Kramer enters.|BRODY|I've never seen such beautiful work.
Jerry's apartment, Kramer enters.|JERRY|What?
Jerry's apartment, Kramer enters.|BRODY|(con,t) You're a genius. The zoom-ins, the framing. I was enchanted.
Jerry's apartment, Kramer enters.|JERRY|Well, I did the best I could.
Jerry's apartment, Kramer enters.|BRODY|I got another project for you. It's a movie called Cry Cry Again. I was gonna give it to one of my other guys, but it's an arty movie and quite frankly, they don't have the sensibility.
Jerry's apartment, Kramer enters.|action|Brody's beeper sounds
Jerry's apartment, Kramer enters.|BRODY|May I use your phone?
Jerry's apartment, Kramer enters.|KRAMER|Uh yeah. It's under the couch.

Jerry's apartment, Kramer enters.|JERRY|I don't want another gig! I'm not doin' this.
Jerry's apartment, Kramer enters.|KRAMER|But you have a gift. Jerry, this is not your little comedy act. We're talkin' feature films.
Jerry's apartment, Kramer enters.|JERRY|We're talkin' federal crime here.
Jerry's apartment, Kramer enters.|action|Brody enters.
Jerry's apartment, Kramer enters.|BRODY|(To Jerry) I'll expect that tape by three o'clock tomorrow. (To Kramer) May I borrow this? (Holding baseball bat)

A meeting at Elaine's office|WORKER|I pressed through the rushes and there, the native dancers whirled before me: limbs flailing, arms akimbo, feet kicking up dust... (All workers laugh)
A meeting at Elaine's office|ELAINE|What? What is so funny?
A meeting at Elaine's office|action|Anna enters with Yankee jacket on.
A meeting at Elaine's office|ANNA|Sorry, I got hung up.
A meeting at Elaine's office|ELAINE|At Yankee Stadium?
A meeting at Elaine's office|ANNA|This? It's mine.
A meeting at Elaine's office|ELAINE|Oh really? 'Cause it looks a little big for you. It looks like something a short, stocky, slow-witted, bald man might wear.
A meeting at Elaine's office|ANNA|He's not stocky.
A meeting at Elaine's office|action|Elaine turns around. A paper airplane is thrown at her.
A meeting at Elaine's office|ELAINE|Who did that? Who did that?!?
Cry, Cry Again, Kramer is bootlegging.|KRAMER|(laughing) The French guy fell off his bike. Oh man, that's precious. (eats popcorn)
Jerry's apartment watching the tape.|JERRY|No, no, no, no, no, no, no! What were you thinking when you shot this?
Jerry's apartment watching the tape.|KRAMER|That's fine.
Jerry's apartment watching the tape.|JERRY|Do you even know what this scene is about?
Jerry's apartment watching the tape.|KRAMER|It's about a guy buying a loaf of bread.
Jerry's apartment watching the tape.|JERRY|No, bread is his soul. He's trying to buy back a loaf of his soul.
Jerry's apartment watching the tape.|action|Gesturing taking a loaf of bread.
Jerry's apartment watching the tape.|KRAMER|Wha? Where?
Jerry's apartment watching the tape.|JERRY|Kramer there is no way you're giving this tape to Brody and telling him I shot it.
Jerry's apartment watching the tape.|KRAMER|Nah, nah, he's not going to know the difference.
Jerry's apartment watching the tape.|JERRY|I don't care about Brody. I was up on 96th Street today, there was a kid couldn't have been more than ten years old. He was asking a street vendor if he had any other bootlegs as good as Death Blow. That's who I care about. The little kid who needs bootlegs, because his parent or guardian won't let him see the excessive violence and strong sexual content you and I take for granted.
Jerry's apartment watching the tape.|KRAMER|So you'll do the movie? (Jerry watches the movie Kramer shot - we hear Kramer, on the tape say 'Ah man, I sat in gum')
Jerry's apartment watching the tape.|JERRY|I have to. But I'm gonna need to storyboard this whole thing. Where are my magic markers?
Jerry's apartment watching the tape.|KRAMER|Right here. (Elaine enters)
Jerry's apartment watching the tape.|ELAINE|Well, I have lost complete control of my staff. Why did I let George go to that party? I mean, we were having so much fun. We were wining, we were dining, we were dancing. (She starts dancing, Kramer flips out) What?
Jerry's apartment watching the tape.|KRAMER|(He shows her) This umpf thing.
Jerry's apartment watching the tape.|ELAINE|It's dancing.
Jerry's apartment watching the tape.|KRAMER|No, no. That ain't dancing, Sally.
Jerry's apartment watching the tape.|ELAINE|I dance fine.
Jerry's apartment watching the tape.|KRAMER|You stink. (He exits)
Jerry's apartment watching the tape.|ELAINE|He doesn't know what he's talkin' about. (Jerry fake laughs) Jer? Jerry, I'm a good dancer, right?
Jerry's apartment watching the tape.|JERRY|I forgot to make my bed. (He tries to get away)
Jerry's apartment watching the tape.|ELAINE|Jerry, do I stink?
Jerry's apartment watching the tape.|JERRY|All right, you're beyond stink.
Jerry's apartment watching the tape.|ELAINE|But I really enjoy dancing.
Jerry's apartment watching the tape.|JERRY|And that's not helpin' either. That's why you're havin' trouble with your staff, not because of George.
Jerry's apartment watching the tape.|ELAINE|It's that bad?
Jerry's apartment watching the tape.|JERRY|Have you ever seen yourself? (She starts dancing) Ah, ah, please, please. Not in my home. I gotta go throw this stuff in the laundry. I'll be right back.

Elaine and Anna sitting in Elaine's office.|GEORGE|What, wha, what're you talkin' about?
Elaine and Anna sitting in Elaine's office.|ELAINE|Well, George, I just want you to hear me say to Anna that you're a good and decent person.
Elaine and Anna sitting in Elaine's office.|GEORGE|Pick up the phone, Elaine. Pick it up!
Elaine and Anna sitting in Elaine's office.|ELAINE|I never should have given Anna the impression--
Elaine and Anna sitting in Elaine's office.|GEORGE|Pick it up, pick it up!

Jerry and Kramer exit the theater and see Brody.|BRODY|I need the tape.
Jerry and Kramer exit the theater and see Brody.|JERRY|You'll get your tape. But here's what I'm gonna need. I'm gonna need three cameras, two on the floor, one in the balcony. And I want headsets for the guys runnin' 'em. I wanna be able to talk to 'em.
Jerry and Kramer exit the theater and see Brody.|BRODY|Are you out of your mind?
Jerry and Kramer exit the theater and see Brody.|JERRY|Kramer...
Jerry and Kramer exit the theater and see Brody.|KRAMER|I know, Jerry. It's okay. (Jerry steps aside) Yeah, look, Brody. Uh, Jerry wants to do the bootleg. He's dyin' to do it. But if you don't make him happy, the work suffers. And then, nobody's happy.
Jerry and Kramer exit the theater and see Brody.|BRODY|Just shoot the damn thing so I can get it out on the street!
Jerry and Kramer exit the theater and see Brody.|JERRY|All right. That's it, I can't work like this.
Jerry and Kramer exit the theater and see Brody.|KRAMER|Jerry...

Jerry and George at Monk's.|JERRY|They think they can get anyone to shoot these bootlegs.
Jerry and George at Monk's.|GEORGE|Anna actually has respect for me now. (laughs/snorts) It's all over.
Jerry and George at Monk's.|JERRY|Eh, the whole business has changed. It's all about money now. The sad thing is it's the kids that suffer. (Kramer enters)
Jerry and George at Monk's.|KRAMER|Listen, man. You gotta shoot this movie for me. Brody, he's a reasonable man, but he's insane!
Jerry and George at Monk's.|JERRY|Kramer, I'm not doin' this anymore. I don't know what I was thinking. It's illegal, it's dangerous...
Jerry and George at Monk's.|GEORGE|Did you say dangerous?
Anna and George in George's car.|GEORGE|I'm a bootlegger.
Anna and George in George's car.|ANNA|You're a what?
Anna and George in George's car.|GEORGE|I'm bootleggin' a movie, baby!
Anna and George in George's car.|ANNA|Isn't that illegal?
