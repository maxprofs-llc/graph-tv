Jerry and George are at a newsstand|JERRY|You got something in your teeth there.
Jerry and George are at a newsstand|GEORGE|What?
Jerry and George are at a newsstand|JERRY|It's green.
Jerry and George are at a newsstand|GEORGE|Oh, man, it's spinach! I've been walking around like this all afternoon.
Jerry and George are at a newsstand|JERRY|Did you bump into anybody you knew?
Jerry and George are at a newsstand|GEORGE|I had a job interview.
Jerry and George are at a newsstand|JERRY|How'd it go?

Jerry and George are at a newsstand|JERRY|Too late for that.
Jerry and George are at a newsstand|GEORGE|'Cause believe me, I would only say this to you and maybe a psychiatrist, maybe. Well, her nose is a little big.
Jerry and George are at a newsstand|JERRY|Yeah, she's got a big nose.
Jerry and George are at a newsstand|GEORGE|I mean, big would even be ok, a little beyond big.
Jerry and George are at a newsstand|action|momentary flashback to Audrey's tremendous nose

Jerry and George are at a newsstand|JERRY|A little.
Jerry and George are at a newsstand|GEORGE|So who am I to be thinking about someone's nose? I mean, I should be grateful someone like her even looks at me. I have no job, nothing. But I have to say, I think about the nose. I don't want to think about the nose. I don't ask to think about the nose, but I think about it. I go to bed at night, I tell myself, 'Don't think about the nose, forget the nose,' but I think about it. I look at her, I see nose.
Jerry and George are at a newsstand|JERRY|Stop being so concerned with looks.
Jerry and George are at a newsstand|action|momentary flashback to Isabel giving Jerry her number
Jerry and George are at a newsstand|JERRY|Have you said anything to her about it?
Jerry and George are at a newsstand|GEORGE|I could never do that. You know the ironic thing is if she had a smaller nose, I never could have gone out with her in the first place. She'd be out of my league with a smaller nose. And I really like her, I know that. And I know one other thing. I'm not getting past that nose.
Jerry and George are at a newsstand|JERRY|Alright, shut up, here they come.
Jerry and George are at a newsstand|GEORGE|(waving) How can I not think about it? Look at the size of this thing.

Jerry, Elaine, George, Audrey and Kramer are sharing a pizza at Jerry's apartment|ELAINE|Kramer!
Jerry, Elaine, George, Audrey and Kramer are sharing a pizza at Jerry's apartment|KRAMER|What? What?
Jerry, Elaine, George, Audrey and Kramer are sharing a pizza at Jerry's apartment|ELAINE|How could you say something like that?!
Jerry, Elaine, George, Audrey and Kramer are sharing a pizza at Jerry's apartment|KRAMER|What? What do you mean? I just said she needs a nose job.
Jerry, Elaine, George, Audrey and Kramer are sharing a pizza at Jerry's apartment|ELAINE|No no, there's nothing wrong with her nose! I'm so sorry, Audrey.
Jerry, Elaine, George, Audrey and Kramer are sharing a pizza at Jerry's apartment|AUDREY|No, it's ok.
Jerry, Elaine, George, Audrey and Kramer are sharing a pizza at Jerry's apartment|ELAINE|What did you have to say that for?

George and Audrey are in Elaine's apartment|AUDREY|You look like you've got something on your mind.
George and Audrey are in Elaine's apartment|GEORGE|Oh, yeah, right. I wish I had something on my mind. (pregnant pause) So how about that Kramer, huh?
George and Audrey are in Elaine's apartment|AUDREY|How about him?

George and Audrey are in Elaine's apartment|GEORGE|Yeah. Yeah, he's quite a character.
George and Audrey are in Elaine's apartment|AUDREY|So, what did you think?
George and Audrey are in Elaine's apartment|GEORGE|About the pizza?
George and Audrey are in Elaine's apartment|AUDREY|No, about the nose job.
George and Audrey are in Elaine's apartment|GEORGE|Oh, the nose job. I don't know, what did you think?
George and Audrey are in Elaine's apartment|AUDREY|Well, I've thought about it, but I don't know.
George and Audrey are in Elaine's apartment|GEORGE|Yeah. (another pause) Not that I care, one way or the other, but these doctors today really do amazing things, you know, if you were so inclined. And again, I'm not suggesting.
George and Audrey are in Elaine's apartment|AUDREY|I know, they're good.
George and Audrey are in Elaine's apartment|GEORGE|Peter Jennings had one.
George and Audrey are in Elaine's apartment|AUDREY|Really?
George and Audrey are in Elaine's apartment|GEORGE|Probably. They all do. In my high school, half my graduating class had them. Of course, I'm from Long Island, so...
George and Audrey are in Elaine's apartment|AUDREY|Uh huh.
George and Audrey are in Elaine's apartment|GEORGE|It's really nothing, it's like going to the dentist.
George and Audrey are in Elaine's apartment|AUDREY|I hate the dentist.
George and Audrey are in Elaine's apartment|GEORGE|It's a cleaning.
George and Audrey are in Elaine's apartment|AUDREY|So you really think I should do this?
George and Audrey are in Elaine's apartment|GEORGE|If it makes you happy, I don't focus on these things. I will tell you this: Unfortunately, we live in a very superficial society. I don't condone it, but it's a fact of life.
George and Audrey are in Elaine's apartment|AUDREY|Well, maybe I should.
George and Audrey are in Elaine's apartment|GEORGE|What the hell.
George and Audrey are in Elaine's apartment|ELAINE|(barging in) Aw, now you talked her into getting a nose job?
George and Audrey are in Elaine's apartment|GEORGE|Me? I didn't say anything.
George and Audrey are in Elaine's apartment|ELAINE|You encouraged her to get one.
George and Audrey are in Elaine's apartment|GEORGE|I didn't encourage. No encourage.
George and Audrey are in Elaine's apartment|ELAINE|Peter Jennings had one?
George and Audrey are in Elaine's apartment|GEORGE|It's possible.
George and Audrey are in Elaine's apartment|ELAINE|Well, I think you should accept her for who she is.
George and Audrey are in Elaine's apartment|AUDREY|No, George is right. I want to get one.
George and Audrey are in Elaine's apartment|ELAINE|I think it's a mistake.
George and Audrey are in Elaine's apartment|GEORGE|Me too, really. Unless you'd really like to get one.
Jerry and George are at the coffee shop|GEORGE|I'm going straight to hell, no two ways about it.

Jerry and George are at the coffee shop|GEORGE|Of course, not as exciting as miss crop circles, but...
Jerry and George are at the coffee shop|JERRY|Please, please, Isabel? She is the most despicable woman I have ever met in my life. I have never been so repulsed by someone mentally and so attracted to them physically at the same time. It's like my brain is facing my penis in a chess game. And I'm letting him win.
Jerry and George are at the coffee shop|GEORGE|You're not letting him win. He wins till you're forty.
Jerry and George are at the coffee shop|JERRY|Then what?
Jerry and George are at the coffee shop|GEORGE|He still wins but it's not a blowout.

Jerry and George are at the coffee shop|GEORGE|It's like going to the bathroom in front of a lot of people and not caring.
Jerry and George are at the coffee shop|JERRY|It's not like that at all.
Elaine, George, Jerry, Kramer and Audrey are at Elaine's apartment|ELAINE|How do you even know the jacket is there?
Elaine, George, Jerry, Kramer and Audrey are at Elaine's apartment|KRAMER|Well I don't, I'm guessing.
Elaine, George, Jerry, Kramer and Audrey are at Elaine's apartment|GEORGE|Okay, look, Audrey, before you take the bandage off just remember that I was the one that encouraged you to do this, you know? Now that you're gonna be a great beauty, let's not forget how this all began. You know, like if you'd listened to your friend, Elaine,
