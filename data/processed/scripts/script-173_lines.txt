Setting: The Coffee shop|ELAINE|(Liking the idea) Ohh.. right. Cause if we're dating, what everyone saw was just a beautiful moment between two lovers.

Setting: Jerry's apartment|KRAMER|(Brainstorming) What about the homeless?
Setting: Jerry's apartment|NEWMAN|Can't we worry about them later?
Setting: Jerry's apartment|KRAMER|(Explaining) To pull the rickshaw.
Setting: Jerry's apartment|NEWMAN|(Pondering Kramer's plan out loud) They do have an intimate knowledge of the street..
Setting: Jerry's apartment|KRAMER|They're always walkin' around the city. Why not just strap something to them?!

Setting: The Coffee shop|JERRY|(Pleading) Leo..
Setting: The Coffee shop|LEO|Alright, alright. Mr. Goody Two-Shoes. You made your point.
Setting: The Coffee shop|JERRY|(Thinking he's stopped Leo's thefts) Thank you.
