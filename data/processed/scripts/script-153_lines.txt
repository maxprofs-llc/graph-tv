Jerry with George and his girlfriend Marcy at Monk's.|GEORGE|So, Marcy, you should've seen me in the hot tub yoday.
Jerry with George and his girlfriend Marcy at Monk's.|MARCY|Why?

Jerry with George and his girlfriend Marcy at Monk's.|GEORGE|Really? What happened?
Jerry with George and his girlfriend Marcy at Monk's.|MARCY|Oh, yada yada yada, just some bad egg salad. I'll be right back. (She gets up)

Jerry with George and his girlfriend Marcy at Monk's.|GEORGE|Is "yada yada" bad?
Jerry with George and his girlfriend Marcy at Monk's.|JERRY|No, "yada yada" is good. She's very succinct.

Elaine and Jerry at his place.|KRAMER|Elaine, all right, who looks better in this shirt? Me or Mickey?
Elaine and Jerry at his place.|MICKEY|We're double dating tonight, and if we wear the same shirt we'll look like idiots.
Elaine and Jerry at his place.|ELAINE|Hmm, turn around. (They turn around) Both so striking.
Elaine and Jerry at his place.|KRAMER|Tell me about it. We just picked up two women at the Gap.
Elaine and Jerry at his place.|ELAINE|How did you decide which one of you would date which girl? (They pause then look at each other)
Marcy and George in his car.|MARCY|So I'm on 3rd Avenue, mindin' my own business, and, yada yada yada, I get a free massage and a facial.
Marcy and George in his car.|GEORGE|What a succinct story.
Marcy and George in his car.|MARCY|I'm surprised you drive a Cadillac.

Cut to the adoption agency.|AGENT|Oh.
Cut to the adoption agency.|ELAINE|Actually, I remember this one time, um, this is funny. Um, we went to see the movie Striptease. I don't know if you've seen... doesn't matter. Anyway, I was whispering something to Beth, and Arnie leens over to me, and he goes, "Would you SHUT UP?!" I mean, he barely even knew me. Where did he get ah-- But they're nice people. (Elaine tries to smile realizing her mistake)
Jerry is in the dental chair when George enters.|GEORGE|Oh, you're in here.
Jerry is in the dental chair when George enters.|JERRY|What're you doing here?
Jerry is in the dental chair when George enters.|GEORGE|I knew you had an appointment.
Jerry is in the dental chair when George enters.|JERRY|Well this is very awkward.

Jerry is in the dental chair when George enters.|JERRY|Hey, you don't play with that. That's going in my mouth.
Jerry is in the dental chair when George enters.|GEORGE|Hey, what this thing? Whew!
Jerry is in the dental chair when George enters.|JERRY|All right, that's enough. Now get going. Get outta here. (Tim and his staff enter)
Jerry is in the dental chair when George enters.|GEORGE|Hey, Tim. Quick question. Is it normal for your teeth to make noises, like a hissing or a chirping?
Jerry is in the dental chair when George enters.|JERRY|George...
Jerry is in the dental chair when George enters.|TIM|Um...
Jerry is in the dental chair when George enters.|GEORGE|Fine, I'll make an appointment. (He leaves)
Jerry is in the dental chair when George enters.|TIM|All right, it is cavity time. Ah, here we go. Which reminds me, did you here the one about the rabbi and the farmer's daughter? Huh?
Jerry is in the dental chair when George enters.|JERRY|Hey.
Jerry is in the dental chair when George enters.|TIM|Those aren't mahtzah balls.
Jerry is in the dental chair when George enters.|JERRY|Tim, do you think you should be making jokes like that?
Jerry is in the dental chair when George enters.|TIM|Why not? I'm Jewish, remember?
Jerry is in the dental chair when George enters.|JERRY|I know, but...
Jerry is in the dental chair when George enters.|TIM|Jerry, it's our sense of humor that sustained us as a people for 3000 years.
Jerry is in the dental chair when George enters.|JERRY|5000.
Jerry is in the dental chair when George enters.|TIM|5000, even better. Okay, Chrissie. Give me a schtickle of flouride.
Jerry and Elaine at Jerry's apartment.|JERRY|And then he asked the assistant for a schtickle of flouride.
Jerry and Elaine at Jerry's apartment.|ELAINE|Why are you so concerned about this?
Jerry and Elaine at Jerry's apartment.|JERRY|I'll tell you why. Because I believe Whatley converted to Judaism just for the jokes. (Phone rings)
Jerry and Elaine at Jerry's apartment.|PHONE|Would you be interested in a subscription to the New York Times?
Jerry and Elaine at Jerry's apartment.|JERRY|Yes. (Slams down phone. Kramer and Mickey enter)
Jerry and Elaine at Jerry's apartment.|KRAMER|I don't believe that.
Jerry and Elaine at Jerry's apartment.|MICKEY|If you had gotten into the backseat of the car we could've figured this whole thing out.
Jerry and Elaine at Jerry's apartment.|KRAMER|Why were you holding the door open for?
Jerry and Elaine at Jerry's apartment.|MICKEY|Not for you! Who holds a door open for a man?
Jerry and Elaine at Jerry's apartment.|KRAMER|Well, I thought it was a nice gesture. But I guess I was wrong!
Jerry and Elaine at Jerry's apartment.|MICKEY|Let's just put they're names in a hat.
Jerry and Elaine at Jerry's apartment.|KRAMER|I don't even know their names! Look, why don't you just take the one that was on the left?
Jerry and Elaine at Jerry's apartment.|MICKEY|I'm not sure she was my type.
Jerry and Elaine at Jerry's apartment.|KRAMER|Oh, everybody's your type.
Jerry and Elaine at Jerry's apartment.|MICKEY|What the hell does that mean?
Jerry and Elaine at Jerry's apartment.|KRAMER|You've been married three times.
Jerry and Elaine at Jerry's apartment.|MICKEY|That's it, it's go time! (Charges toward Kramer, only to be held back by Jerry and Elaine)
Jerry and Elaine at Jerry's apartment.|JERRY|All right, take it easy.
Jerry and Elaine at Jerry's apartment.|ELAINE|Hey, hey, hey!
Jerry and Elaine at Jerry's apartment.|KRAMER|Come on, let him go. You want throw? Let's throw!
Jerry and Elaine at Jerry's apartment.|ELAINE|Hey! Hold on a second. All right, look, I got an idea. Why don't you just show up early for your next date, sit across from each other, and see who the girls sit next to.
Jerry and Elaine at Jerry's apartment.|MICKEY|That's not bad.
Jerry and Elaine at Jerry's apartment.|KRAMER|All right, so we let the girls decide.
Jerry and Elaine at Jerry's apartment.|MICKEY|Yeah, why should we knock ourselves out?
Jerry and Elaine at Jerry's apartment.|KRAMER|Yeah, I wanna wear that shirt next time.
Jerry and Elaine at Jerry's apartment.|MICKEY|No, no one wears the shirt next time.
Jerry and Elaine at Jerry's apartment.|KRAMER|That's right, 'cause they already saw it.
Jerry and Elaine at Jerry's apartment.|MICKEY|We'll look like idiots. (They exit)
George and Marcy at Monk's.|GEORGE|Well, we were engaged to be married, uh, we bought the wedding invitations, and, uh, yada yada yada, I'm still single.
George and Marcy at Monk's.|MARCY|So what's she doing now?
George and Marcy at Monk's.|GEORGE|Yada.
George and Marcy at Monk's.|MARCY|Speaking of ex's, my old boyfriend came over late last night, and, yada yada yada, anyway. I'm really tired today.
Beth and Arnie see Elaine walking down the street.|ELAINE|Beth, Arnie, hi. What's up?
Beth and Arnie see Elaine walking down the street.|ARNIE|Well our adoption application was denied.
Beth and Arnie see Elaine walking down the street.|ELAINE|Really.
Beth and Arnie see Elaine walking down the street.|BETH|The adoption agent seems to feel that Arnie has a violent temper.
Beth and Arnie see Elaine walking down the street.|ELAINE|Oh.
Beth and Arnie see Elaine walking down the street.|BETH|So we're just asking our friends what they may have said to the adoption agent.
Beth and Arnie see Elaine walking down the street.|ELAINE|Uh, you know, I just told them what kind people you are and, uh, yada yada yada, that is it.
Cut to the dentist waiting room.|JERRY|How you doing?
Cut to the dentist waiting room.|FATHER|I have a discomfort in my molar. (Enter Tim)
Cut to the dentist waiting room.|TIM|Well, the Curtis, why don't you come in? (To Jerry) Father Curtis, good guy. Oh, which reminds me, did you hear the one about the Pope and Raquel Welch on the lifeboat, huh? I'll tell you later. (Exits)
Cut to the dentist waiting room.|JERRY|Whatley. (Like "Newman")
At Kramer and Mickey's date, they enter to find the girls already at the table.|KRAMER|What are they doing here?
At Kramer and Mickey's date, they enter to find the girls already at the table.|MICKEY|I told you we should've gotten here a half hour early.
At Kramer and Mickey's date, they enter to find the girls already at the table.|KRAMER|All right, all right. Now what're we gonna do?
At Kramer and Mickey's date, they enter to find the girls already at the table.|MICKEY|All right, don't panic. Let's just decide now. Which one do you want?
At Kramer and Mickey's date, they enter to find the girls already at the table.|KRAMER|All right, I'll take Julie.
At Kramer and Mickey's date, they enter to find the girls already at the table.|MICKEY|I knew you wanted her. That's who I wanted.
At Kramer and Mickey's date, they enter to find the girls already at the table.|KRAMER|All right, I'll take Karen.
At Kramer and Mickey's date, they enter to find the girls already at the table.|MICKEY|No, no, you think I'm fallin' for that? I'll take Karen.
At Kramer and Mickey's date, they enter to find the girls already at the table.|KRAMER|All right, which one is Julie? (They walk over to the table and fight over who sits where) Hey, you ladies look lovely tonight. (Continue to struggle)
Jerry's.|JERRY|So Whatley sayd to me, "Hey, I can make Catholic jokes, I used to be Catholic."
Jerry's.|ELAINE|You see, I don't think it is a Catholic joke. I think it's more of a Raquel Welch joke. What was it? No, I said hand me the buoys. (Laughing) Bouys!
Jerry's.|JERRY|Don't you see what Whatley is after? Total joke telling immunity. He's already got the two big religions covered, if he ever gets Polish citizenship there'll be no stopping him.
Jerry's.|ELAINE|So what're you gonna do?
Jerry's.|JERRY|I think this Father Curtis might be very interested to hear what Whatley has the Pope doing with Raquel Welch.
Jerry's.|ELAINE|(Calling on phone) Hey, Beth, Arnie, it's Elaine. Um, thought you guys might wanna have lunch. Gimme a call. Bye.
Jerry's.|JERRY|They're not getting a baby so you're taking them out to lunch?
Jerry's.|ELAINE|Thought it would be nice.
Jerry's.|JERRY|Poor Beth.
Jerry's.|ELAINE|Hey, Arnie's just as upset.
Jerry's.|JERRY|Oh screw him! (George enters)
Jerry's.|GEORGE|Listen to this. Marcy comes up and she tells me her ex-boyfriend was over late last night, and "yada yada yada, I'm really tired today." You don't think she yada yada'd sex.
Jerry's.|ELAINE|(Raising hand) I've yada yada'd sex.
Jerry's.|GEORGE|Really?
Jerry's.|ELAINE|Yeah. I met this lawyer, we went out to dinner, I had the lobster bisk, we went back to my place, yada yada yada, I never heard from him again.
Jerry's.|JERRY|But you yada yada'd over the best part.
Jerry's.|ELAINE|No, I mentioned the bisk.
Jerry's.|GEORGE|Well, I gotta do somethin'. (Walks over to bathroom. Kramer enters)
Jerry's.|KRAMER|Well, I gotta do somethin'.
Jerry's.|JERRY|George is already in there.
Jerry's.|KRAMER|(Confused) No, Mickey and I, we can't work it out. You know, I'm thinking of asking that Karen out by myself.
Jerry's.|JERRY|I thought you were leaning towards Julie.
Jerry's.|KRAMER|I was, but the one I thought was Julie turned out to be Karen.
George and Marcy at Monk's.|GEORGE|Well it was a helluva yada yada.
George and Marcy at Monk's.|MARCY|He's moving to Seattle. We wanted to say goodbye, I was just getting out of the shower, and yada yada yada--
George and Marcy at Monk's.|GEORGE|All right, enough! Enough! From now on, no more yada yada's. Just give me the full story.
George and Marcy at Monk's.|MARCY|Okay.
George and Marcy at Monk's.|GEORGE|Tell me about the free facial.
George and Marcy at Monk's.|MARCY|Okay, well, like I said I was on 3rd Avenue, and I stopped by a large department store.
George and Marcy at Monk's.|GEORGE|Which one?
George and Marcy at Monk's.|MARCY|Bloomingdale's.
George and Marcy at Monk's.|GEORGE|Very good. Go on.
George and Marcy at Monk's.|MARCY|Oh, and I stole a Piaget watch.
George and Marcy at Monk's.|GEORGE|What's that?
George and Marcy at Monk's.|MARCY|And then, I was on such a... high, that I went upstairs to the salon on the fifth floor, and got a massage and facial, and skipped out on the bill.
George and Marcy at Monk's.|GEORGE|Shoplifting.
George and Marcy at Monk's.|MARCY|Well, what about you? You told me that you were engaged. What was the rest of that? (Pause)
Jerry at the church approaches a nun.|JERRY|Excuse me, Mother?
Jerry at the church approaches a nun.|NUN|Sister.
Jerry at the church approaches a nun.|JERRY|Sister, right. Do you know when Father Curtis has office hours?
Jerry at the church approaches a nun.|NUN|Well not until tomorrow.
Jerry at the church approaches a nun.|JERRY|Hmm, I really need to speak with him.
Jerry at the church approaches a nun.|action|Jerry enters confessional, sits down on kneeler. Father Curtis opens sliding door.
Jerry at the church approaches a nun.|FATHER|That's a kneeler.
Jerry at the church approaches a nun.|JERRY|Oh. (Adjusts accordingly)
Jerry at the church approaches a nun.|FATHER|Tell me your sins, my son.
Jerry at the church approaches a nun.|JERRY|Well I should tell you that I'm Jewish.
Jerry at the church approaches a nun.|FATHER|That's no sin.
Jerry at the church approaches a nun.|JERRY|Oh good. Anyway, I wanted to talk to you about Dr. Whatley. I have a suspicion that he's converted to Judaism just for the jokes.
Jerry at the church approaches a nun.|FATHER|And this offends you as a Jewish person.
Jerry at the church approaches a nun.|JERRY|No, it offends me as a comedian. And it'll interest you that he's also telling Catholic jokes.
Jerry at the church approaches a nun.|FATHER|Well.
Jerry at the church approaches a nun.|JERRY|And they're old jokes. I mean, the Pope and Raquel Welch in a lifeboat.
Jerry at the church approaches a nun.|FATHER|I haven't heard that one.
Jerry at the church approaches a nun.|JERRY|Oh, I'm sure you have. They're out on the ocean and, yada yada yada, and she says, "Those aren't buoys." (Father starts laughing) Father...
Jerry at the church approaches a nun.|FATHER|One second... Well, if it would make you feel better I could speak to Dr. Whatley. I have to go back and have a wisdom teeth removed.
Jerry at the church approaches a nun.|JERRY|You know the difference between a dentist and a sadist don't you?
Jerry at the church approaches a nun.|FATHER|Um...
Jerry at the church approaches a nun.|JERRY|Newer magazines.
Jerry at the church approaches a nun.|FATHER|Now if you'll excuse me. (Closes door. George enters confessional.)
Jerry at the church approaches a nun.|GEORGE|Jerry, I gotta talk to you.
Kramer knocks on Karen's apartment door, she opens the door.|KRAMER|Hi.

At Monk's, Arnie is talking to Elaine.|ARNIE|All right, shut up!
At Monk's, Arnie is talking to Elaine.|ELAINE|Again you are telling me to shut up?
At Monk's, Arnie is talking to Elaine.|ARNIE|What?
At Monk's, Arnie is talking to Elaine.|ELAINE|You yelled that time at the movies. That's why you're not getting the baby.
At Monk's, Arnie is talking to Elaine.|ARNIE|Oh my God. How am I gonna tell Beth?
At Monk's, Arnie is talking to Elaine.|ELAINE|Look, I'll go down and talk to this adoption guy and I'll make sure that it all gets worked out.
At Monk's, Arnie is talking to Elaine.|ARNIE|All right, just don't screw it up this time! (He exits)
At Monk's, Arnie is talking to Elaine.|ELAINE|See, again with the yelling. Not a fan of the yelling.
At the dentist, Tim is working on Jerry.|JERRY|(In pain) Oh, are you about done?
At the dentist, Tim is working on Jerry.|TIM|I'm just getting warmed up. Because I'm just a sadist with newer magazines.
At the dentist, Tim is working on Jerry.|JERRY|Huh?
At the dentist, Tim is working on Jerry.|TIM|Father Curtis told me about your little joke.
At the dentist, Tim is working on Jerry.|JERRY|What about all your Jewish jokes?
At the dentist, Tim is working on Jerry.|TIM|I'm Jewish, you're not a dentist. You have no idea what my people have been through.
At the dentist, Tim is working on Jerry.|JERRY|The Jews?
At the dentist, Tim is working on Jerry.|TIM|No, the dentists. You know, we have the highest suicide rate of any profession?

Jerry enters his apartment to see Kramer talking on his phone.|JERRY|So you won't believe what happened with Whatley today. It got back to hime that I made this little dentist joke and he got all offended. Those people can be so touchy.
Jerry enters his apartment to see Kramer talking on his phone.|KRAMER|Those people, listen to yourself.
Jerry enters his apartment to see Kramer talking on his phone.|JERRY|What?
Jerry enters his apartment to see Kramer talking on his phone.|KRAMER|You think that dentists are so different from me and you? They came to this country just like everybody else, in search of a dream.
Jerry enters his apartment to see Kramer talking on his phone.|JERRY|Kramer, he's just a dentist.
Jerry enters his apartment to see Kramer talking on his phone.|KRAMER|Yeah, and you're an anti-dentite.
Jerry enters his apartment to see Kramer talking on his phone.|JERRY|I am not an anti-dentite!
Jerry enters his apartment to see Kramer talking on his phone.|KRAMER|You're a rabid anti-dentite! Oh, it starts with a few jokes and some slurs. "Hey, denty!" Next thing you know you're saying they should have their own schools.

Beth enters Jerry's place.|JERRY|Well, I wouldn't put anything past anybody.
Beth enters Jerry's place.|BETH|But we just got married.
Beth enters Jerry's place.|JERRY|Well obviously that was a mistake. You need to forget about Arnie. The important thing is you're moving on.

Beth enters Jerry's place.|JERRY|Forget about Elaine. Let's just focus on us. Come on, big hug. (Mickey and Karen enter)
