Jerry and George talking near a bar.|JERRY|We're dead.
Jerry and George talking near a bar.|GEORGE|We're not dead.
Jerry and George talking near a bar.|JERRY|We are dead.
Jerry and George talking near a bar.|GEORGE|Come on. We got all day tomorrow to come up with a story.
Jerry and George talking near a bar.|JERRY|All day tomorrow? We had a month and a half to come up with something and we didn't do anything.
Jerry and George talking near a bar.|GEORGE|So we'll do it tomorrow.
Jerry and George talking near a bar.|JERRY|Let me ask you something. When's the last time you went skiing?
Jerry and George talking near a bar.|GEORGE|About six years ago.
Jerry and George talking near a bar.|JERRY|I think you can take the lift ticket off your jacket now.
Jerry and George talking near a bar.|GEORGE|Women like skiers.
Jerry and George talking near a bar.|JERRY|So what? You can't meet anybody. You're going on with Susan.
Jerry and George talking near a bar.|GEORGE|Yeah. Right.
Jerry and George talking near a bar.|JERRY|Hey, see those two women over there? I almost dated the one on the right. She's in the closet business.
Jerry and George talking near a bar.|GEORGE|The closet business? What's the closet business?
Jerry and George talking near a bar.|JERRY|What is it your business?
Jerry and George talking near a bar.|GEORGE|I'm interested.
Jerry and George talking near a bar.|JERRY|She reorganizes your closet and shows you how to maximize your closet space. She looked into my closet.
Jerry and George talking near a bar.|GEORGE|So you thought she was good looking and figured this would be a good way to meet her.
Jerry and George talking near a bar.|JERRY|Yeah.
Jerry and George talking near a bar.|GEORGE|Yeah. So what happened?
Jerry and George talking near a bar.|JERRY|So, she mentioned she had a boyfriend and then it hit me. What do I need more closet space for? (Across the room) Hi, Marla.
Jerry and George talking near a bar.|MARLA|(Walks over to Jerry and George) Jerry.
Jerry and George talking near a bar.|JERRY|George, Marla.
Jerry and George talking near a bar.|GEORGE|Marla.
Jerry and George talking near a bar.|MARLA|George. Jerry, Stacey.
Jerry and George talking near a bar.|JERRY|Stacey.
Jerry and George talking near a bar.|STACEY|Jerry.
Jerry and George talking near a bar.|JERRY|George, Stacey.
Jerry and George talking near a bar.|GEORGE|Stacey.
Jerry and George talking near a bar.|STACEY|George.
Jerry and George talking near a bar.|JERRY|George.
Jerry and George talking near a bar.|GEORGE|Jerry. Marla. (Realizing Jerry's cue) Stacey! (Walks over to Stacey)
Jerry and George talking near a bar.|MARLA|So, how was your trip to Berlin?
Jerry and George talking near a bar.|JERRY|Trip to Berlin?
Jerry and George talking near a bar.|MARLA|Remember? That's why you put off doing the closets. You said you were going to Berlin for a while.
Jerry and George talking near a bar.|JERRY|Oh, right, right.
Jerry and George talking near a bar.|MARLA|The wall had just come down, and you told me you wanted to be part of the celebration.
Jerry and George talking near a bar.|JERRY|Yes, yes, I did. But, you know, I was watching it on CNN, and they covered it so well I thought, "Why knock my brains out?"
Jerry and George talking near a bar.|MARLA|You, know my boyfriend went.
Jerry and George talking near a bar.|JERRY|Really?
Jerry and George talking near a bar.|MARLA|Yes, I told him all about you going and he got all excited and decided to go.
Jerry and George talking near a bar.|JERRY|Oh, did he like it?
Jerry and George talking near a bar.|MARLA|I don't know. He never came back. (Over to the other side of the bar)
Jerry and George talking near a bar.|GEORGE|Anyway, we met with NBC about a month ago and they gave us the green light to go ahead and write a pilot. In fact, we got a big meeting with them tomorrow. They gotta approve of the story before we can write.
Jerry and George talking near a bar.|STACEY|Wow, what a great job. A writer.
Jerry and George talking near a bar.|GEORGE|Not a bad way to make a buck.
Jerry and George talking near a bar.|STACEY|Sounds great.
Jerry and George talking near a bar.|GEORGE|Well, I'll tell you, Stacey. It's a lot of hard work. But, it comes fairly easy to me. Some people write symphonies. This is my gift. (Raises ski lift ticket while Stacey looks away)
Jerry and George at Monk's|JERRY|So, are you gonna go out with her?
Jerry and George at Monk's|GEORGE|I might.
Jerry and George at Monk's|JERRY|What about Susan?
Jerry and George at Monk's|GEORGE|What? I'm not married. I'm not allowed to go out with somebody else?
Jerry and George at Monk's|JERRY|Depends.
Jerry and George at Monk's|GEORGE|Depends on what?
Jerry and George at Monk's|JERRY|On many factors.
Jerry and George at Monk's|GEORGE|Like what?
Jerry and George at Monk's|JERRY|Well, how long you've been seeing her. What's your phone call frequency? Are you on a daily?
Jerry and George at Monk's|GEORGE|No. Semi-daily. Four or five times a week.
Jerry and George at Monk's|JERRY|What about Saturday nights? Do you have to ask her out, or is a date implied?
Jerry and George at Monk's|GEORGE|Implied.
Jerry and George at Monk's|JERRY|She got anything in your medicine cabinet?
Jerry and George at Monk's|GEORGE|There might be some moisturizer.
Jerry and George at Monk's|JERRY|Ah hah. Let me ask you this. Is there any tampax in your house?
Jerry and George at Monk's|GEORGE|(Pause) Yeah.
Jerry and George at Monk's|JERRY|Well, I'll tell you what you've got here.
Jerry and George at Monk's|GEORGE|What?
Jerry and George at Monk's|JERRY|You got yourself a girlfriend.
Jerry and George at Monk's|GEORGE|Ah, no, no. Are you sure? A girlfriend?
Jerry and George at Monk's|JERRY|I'm looking at a guy in a semi-daily with tampax in his house and an implied date on Saturday night. I would like to help you out, but...
Jerry and George at Monk's|GEORGE|Would you believe my luck? The first time in my life I have a good answer to the question, "What do you do?" and I have a girlfriend. I mean, you don't need a girlfriend when you can answer that question. That's what you say in order to get girlfriends. Once you can get a girlfriend, you don't want a girlfriend, you just want more girlfriends.
Jerry and George at Monk's|JERRY|You're going to make a good father someday.
Jerry and George at Monk's|GEORGE|Well it's not fair, Jerry. It's just not fair. All right, all right. That's it. I'm getting out of this thing.
Jerry and George at Monk's|JERRY|Fine. Break up with her. But you know what this means?
Jerry and George at Monk's|GEORGE|No, what?
Jerry and George at Monk's|JERRY|The script, the pilot, the TV show. That's all over.
Jerry and George at Monk's|GEORGE|Why? What do you mean?
Jerry and George at Monk's|JERRY|Figure it out. She's one of the executives at NBC that's gonna make the decision whether or not they pick up the show. She's one of our biggest fans. You drop her off, you think they're gonna pick us up?
Jerry and George at Monk's|GEORGE|Oh, right. Oh no, man.
Jerry and George at Monk's|JERRY|you know, it's a very interesting situation. Here you have a job that can get you girls. But, you also have a relationship. But if you try and get rid of the relationship so you can get the girls, you lose the job. You see the irony?
Jerry and George at Monk's|GEORGE|Yeah, yeah. I see the irony. All right. What about this? What if I can find some way to break up with her so that she'll still like me and it doesn't affect the deal.
Jerry and George at Monk's|JERRY|(sarcastically) Oh, yeah.
Jerry and George at Monk's|GEORGE|Wait, wait. Here me out. Don't dismiss this. You're very quick to dismiss. Don't dismiss. She's got a big crush on David Letterman, I mean, a big crush. She talks about him all the time. Suppose I go up to David Letterman. He works at NBC; I work at NBC. I explain my situation. He agrees to meet her. They go out, they fall madly in love. And she dumps me for David Letterman.
Jerry and George at Monk's|JERRY|This is your plan?
Jerry and George at Monk's|GEORGE|No, no. I'm just thinking.
Jerry and George at Monk's|JERRY|I don't think you are.
Jerry with Marla, who is measuring his closet space.|MARLA|Let me tell you what I think.
Jerry with Marla, who is measuring his closet space.|JERRY|Please, and be brutal. I have no closet sensitivity.
Jerry with Marla, who is measuring his closet space.|MARLA|Are you very fussy about your pants?
Jerry with Marla, who is measuring his closet space.|JERRY|I don't think I am.
Jerry with Marla, who is measuring his closet space.|MARLA|Because I have a very radical idea. Can you handle it?
Jerry with Marla, who is measuring his closet space.|JERRY|Try me.
Jerry with Marla, who is measuring his closet space.|MARLA|Here's what I'm proposing. We eliminate all this. The hangers, the bar, the shelves. And in its place install a series of hooks. We'll put everything on hooks.
Jerry with Marla, who is measuring his closet space.|JERRY|Everything?
Jerry with Marla, who is measuring his closet space.|MARLA|Everything. The shirts, pants, sport jackets, pajamas. We could get eighty hooks on here.
Jerry with Marla, who is measuring his closet space.|JERRY|You're quite mad, you know. (Kramer enters) Oh, I don't believe this. (Goes into other room) Hey?
Jerry with Marla, who is measuring his closet space.|KRAMER|Hey.
Jerry with Marla, who is measuring his closet space.|JERRY|What are you doing?
Jerry with Marla, who is measuring his closet space.|KRAMER|I'm watching The Bold and the Beautiful.
Jerry with Marla, who is measuring his closet space.|JERRY|No.
Jerry with Marla, who is measuring his closet space.|KRAMER|What?
Jerry with Marla, who is measuring his closet space.|JERRY|This is not a good time.
Jerry with Marla, who is measuring his closet space.|KRAMER|Five minutes. What?
Jerry with Marla, who is measuring his closet space.|JERRY|What did you have to give your TV away to George for?
Jerry with Marla, who is measuring his closet space.|KRAMER|Because I've been watching too much. It was an addiction. I couldn't stop. It was, it was destroying my brain cells.
Jerry with Marla, who is measuring his closet space.|JERRY|Yeah, but now you're in here all the time. (Marla enters from other room)
Jerry with Marla, who is measuring his closet space.|KRAMER|Well, wow.
Jerry with Marla, who is measuring his closet space.|JERRY|Marla, Kramer.
Jerry with Marla, who is measuring his closet space.|KRAMER|Hey.
Jerry with Marla, who is measuring his closet space.|JERRY|Why don't you go out? It's nice out.
Jerry with Marla, who is measuring his closet space.|KRAMER|Oh, no. There's nothing out there for me.
Jerry with Marla, who is measuring his closet space.|JERRY|There's weather.
Jerry with Marla, who is measuring his closet space.|KRAMER|Weather? I don't need weather. Weather doesn't do it for me.
Jerry with Marla, who is measuring his closet space.|JERRY|I'm tellin' George to give you your TV back.
Jerry with Marla, who is measuring his closet space.|KRAMER|No, no, I don't want it back. (Pause) Are you gonna watch the Knick game tonight?
Jerry with Marla, who is measuring his closet space.|JERRY|I don't know.
Jerry with Marla, who is measuring his closet space.|KRAMER|Will you tape it?
Jerry with Marla, who is measuring his closet space.|JERRY|Kramer... (points to Marla)
Jerry with Marla, who is measuring his closet space.|KRAMER|Yeah. (He exits)
Jerry with Marla, who is measuring his closet space.|JERRY|So your boyfriend never came back from Berlin.
Jerry with Marla, who is measuring his closet space.|MARLA|Never came back.
Jerry with Marla, who is measuring his closet space.|JERRY|Oh, you must have been devastated being left for a wall.
Jerry with Marla, who is measuring his closet space.|MARLA|It was about to end anyway. There was this... problem.
Jerry with Marla, who is measuring his closet space.|JERRY|Ah hah. (Buzzer) Excuse me one second. Yeah?
Jerry with Marla, who is measuring his closet space.|ELAINE|It's me.
Jerry with Marla, who is measuring his closet space.|JERRY|Come on up. Oh, it's Elaine, she's just a friend of mine. I don't know what she's doing here now. (Buzzer) I'm sorry. What?
Jerry with Marla, who is measuring his closet space.|ELAINE|I didn't get it.
Jerry with Marla, who is measuring his closet space.|JERRY|Ugh. So you were saying there was this problem.
Jerry with Marla, who is measuring his closet space.|MARLA|Well, he wanted me to move in with him.
Jerry with Marla, who is measuring his closet space.|JERRY|Snapple?
Jerry with Marla, who is measuring his closet space.|MARLA|No thanks.
Jerry with Marla, who is measuring his closet space.|JERRY|Go on.
Jerry with Marla, who is measuring his closet space.|MARLA|Well I wouldn't move in because...
Jerry with Marla, who is measuring his closet space.|JERRY|Yes.
Jerry with Marla, who is measuring his closet space.|MARLA|Well because...
Jerry with Marla, who is measuring his closet space.|JERRY|Yeah.
Jerry with Marla, who is measuring his closet space.|MARLA|Well because I'm a virgin. (Elaine enters)
Jerry with Marla, who is measuring his closet space.|ELAINE|Hello!
Jerry with Marla, who is measuring his closet space.|JERRY|Hi, um. Marla, Elaine.
Jerry with Marla, who is measuring his closet space.|ELAINE|I'm sorry, I didn't know you had company. I just wanted to return your tape.
Jerry with Marla, who is measuring his closet space.|JERRY|Oh, thanks a lot, two weeks late. Now that costs me thirty-five dollars to see Havana.
Jerry with Marla, who is measuring his closet space.|ELAINE|I'm sorry, I really am. I just kept forgetting.
Jerry with Marla, who is measuring his closet space.|MARLA|I should be going.
Jerry with Marla, who is measuring his closet space.|ELAINE|No, no, I'm leaving.
Jerry with Marla, who is measuring his closet space.|JERRY|I like that thing in your hair there.
Jerry with Marla, who is measuring his closet space.|ELAINE|Oh yeah? This woman was selling them at this crazy party I was at last night. You'll appreciate this. Snapple?
Jerry with Marla, who is measuring his closet space.|MARLA|No thanks.
Jerry with Marla, who is measuring his closet space.|ELAINE|I was talking to this guy, you know, and I just happened to throw my purse on the sofa. And my diaphragm goes flying out. So I just froze, you know, ahh! Staring at my diaphragm. You know, it's just lying there. So then, this woman, the one who sold me this hair thing, she grabbed it before the guy noticed, so. I mean, big deal, right? So I carry around my diaphragm, who doesn't? Yeah, like it's a big, big secret that women carry around their diaphragms. You never know when you're gonna need it, right? (Sips the Snapple) Ahh.
Jerry with Marla, who is measuring his closet space.|MARLA|I should be going.
Jerry with Marla, who is measuring his closet space.|JERRY|So we'll talk about the hooks then?
Jerry with Marla, who is measuring his closet space.|MARLA|Yes. (She exits)
Jerry with Marla, who is measuring his closet space.|ELAINE|What? Was it something I said?
Jerry with Marla, who is measuring his closet space.|JERRY|She's a virgin, she just told me.
Jerry with Marla, who is measuring his closet space.|ELAINE|Well I didn't know.
Jerry with Marla, who is measuring his closet space.|JERRY|Well it's not like spotting a toupee.
Jerry with Marla, who is measuring his closet space.|ELAINE|Well you think I should say something? Should I say something? Should I apologize? Was I being anti-virgin?
Jerry with Marla, who is measuring his closet space.|JERRY|No, no, I mean...
Jerry with Marla, who is measuring his closet space.|ELAINE|'Cause I'm not anti-virgin. I'll be right back. (She leaves)
Jerry with Marla, who is measuring his closet space.|JERRY|Elaine, Elaine... (Buzzer) Yeah?
Jerry with Marla, who is measuring his closet space.|GEORGE|It's George.
Cut to George looking out Jerry's apartment at Marla.|GEORGE|She's a virgin?
Cut to George looking out Jerry's apartment at Marla.|JERRY|A virgin.
Cut to George looking out Jerry's apartment at Marla.|GEORGE|Wow. So what're you gonna do?
Cut to George looking out Jerry's apartment at Marla.|JERRY|I don't know. I'm very attracted to her. That accent, it's so sexy.
Cut to George looking out Jerry's apartment at Marla.|GEORGE|I don't think I could do it. You know, they always remember the first time. I don't want to be remembered. I wanna be forgotten.
Cut to George looking out Jerry's apartment at Marla.|JERRY|You need a little pioneer spirit. You know, you don't have any of that Lewis and Clark in you.
Cut to George looking out Jerry's apartment at Marla.|GEORGE|You know, sometimes those guys don't make it back. (Looks in fridge) I'm really hungry.
Cut to George looking out Jerry's apartment at Marla.|JERRY|Yeah, me too.
Cut to George looking out Jerry's apartment at Marla.|GEORGE|We gotta get something. I don't want to go to that meeting on an empty stomach. Let's get some Chinese. You wanna order it?
Cut to George looking out Jerry's apartment at Marla.|JERRY|All right, but then we gotta get some work done. Let me just call Kramer, see if want anything. (Calls) Hey, we ordering Chinese food. If you want anything-- (Kramer enters quickly) let me know what it is and I'll order for you.
Cut to George looking out Jerry's apartment at Marla.|KRAMER|I'm in. Let's go for it.
Cut to George looking out Jerry's apartment at Marla.|GEORGE|What do you want?
Cut to George looking out Jerry's apartment at Marla.|KRAMER|I don't care, whatever.
Cut to George looking out Jerry's apartment at Marla.|GEORGE|I'll tell you what. Why don't we just get a couple of dishes and we'll just share 'em.
Cut to George looking out Jerry's apartment at Marla.|KRAMER|Okay. What are you getting?
Cut to George looking out Jerry's apartment at Marla.|GEORGE|I'm gonna get a Chow Fung.
Cut to George looking out Jerry's apartment at Marla.|KRAMER|What's a Chow Fung?
Cut to George looking out Jerry's apartment at Marla.|GEORGE|It's a broad noodle.
Cut to George looking out Jerry's apartment at Marla.|KRAMER|What do you mean, a broad noodle?
Cut to George looking out Jerry's apartment at Marla.|GEORGE|It's a big flat noodle.
Cut to George looking out Jerry's apartment at Marla.|KRAMER|Well I don't want a big flat noodle.
Cut to George looking out Jerry's apartment at Marla.|GEORGE|What kind of noodle do you want?
Cut to George looking out Jerry's apartment at Marla.|KRAMER|Who says I want a noodle?
Cut to George looking out Jerry's apartment at Marla.|GEORGE|All right, look. I'm getting the Chow Fung. You don't have to have any.
Cut to George looking out Jerry's apartment at Marla.|KRAMER|All right. I'll get pea pods and you can't have any of my pea pods.
Cut to George looking out Jerry's apartment at Marla.|GEORGE|Fine.
Cut to George looking out Jerry's apartment at Marla.|KRAMER|Get extra MSG.
Elaine and Marla at Monk's Cafe.|ELAINE|Look, Marla. This whole sex thing is totally overrated. Now, here's the one thing you've gotta be ready for is how the man changes into a completely different person five seconds after it's over. I mean, something happens to their personality it's really quite astounding. It's like they committed a crime and they want to flee the scene before the police get there.
Elaine and Marla at Monk's Cafe.|MARLA|So they just leave?
Elaine and Marla at Monk's Cafe.|ELAINE|Yeah, pretty much, yeah. Well, the smart ones start working on their getaway stories during dinner. How, you know, they gotta get up early tomorrow. What is about being up early? They all turn into farmers suddenly.
Elaine and Marla at Monk's Cafe.|MARLA|Wow. It must be pretty good to put up with all that.
Elaine and Marla at Monk's Cafe.|ELAINE|Eh.
Jerry's place, George and Jerry are sitting.|JERRY|All right, let's go. We don't have much time before the meeting.
Jerry's place, George and Jerry are sitting.|GEORGE|Where's the food? What happened to Ping?
Jerry's place, George and Jerry are sitting.|JERRY|Don't worry, he'll be here. Look, we only got about two hours. We just need to come up with one good story so we can get through this meeting. (Buzzer) There's your food.
Jerry's place, George and Jerry are sitting.|GEORGE|Hey, what about this? I'm in a car accident. The motorist is uninsured, you with me?
Jerry's place, George and Jerry are sitting.|JERRY|Yeah.
Jerry's place, George and Jerry are sitting.|GEORGE|My car's totaled. It's all his fault and now, he has absolutely no money. There is no way that he can pay me. So the judge decrees that he becomes my butler.
Jerry's place, George and Jerry are sitting.|JERRY|Your butler?
Jerry's place, George and Jerry are sitting.|GEORGE|Right. He cooks my food, he cleans my house, he does all my shopping for me. And there you go, that's your program.
Jerry's place, George and Jerry are sitting.|JERRY|What about me?
Jerry's place, George and Jerry are sitting.|GEORGE|Don't worry, we'll find something for you. (Knock of Jerry's door)
Jerry's place, George and Jerry are sitting.|JERRY|(Getting the door) That's the stupidest idea I ever heard. Sentenced to be a butler. (Elaine, Marla, and an injured Ping are at the door) Ping, what happened?
Jerry's place, George and Jerry are sitting.|ELAINE|There was a bit of an accident.
Jerry's place, George and Jerry are sitting.|PING|Head hurts. Head really hurts.
Jerry's place, George and Jerry are sitting.|JERRY|What happened?
Jerry's place, George and Jerry are sitting.|ELAINE|Marla and I went out for coffee and afterwards I was crossing the street and he was biking right towards me. So I got out of the way just in time, but then he ran into a parked car. He hit his head and everything went flying.
Jerry's place, George and Jerry are sitting.|GEORGE|Something happened to the food?
Jerry's place, George and Jerry are sitting.|PING|I only saved one bag.
Jerry's place, George and Jerry are sitting.|JERRY|Should I call an ambulance? Do you wanna see a doctor?
Jerry's place, George and Jerry are sitting.|MARLA|I'll get some ice.
Jerry's place, George and Jerry are sitting.|GEORGE|(After looking in the bag) The pea pods? All you saved was the pea pods? (Kramer enters)
Jerry's place, George and Jerry are sitting.|KRAMER|Hey, you got the food?
Jerry's place, George and Jerry are sitting.|JERRY|Yeah, here.
Jerry's place, George and Jerry are sitting.|KRAMER|What took you so long? Hey, Ping!
Jerry's place, George and Jerry are sitting.|PING|Kramer. (Kramer and George sit on the couch)
Jerry's place, George and Jerry are sitting.|KRAMER|Yeah. Where's yours?
Jerry's place, George and Jerry are sitting.|GEORGE|He dropped it.
Jerry's place, George and Jerry are sitting.|KRAMER|Oh, that's too bad.
Jerry's place, George and Jerry are sitting.|ELAINE|You should slow down, you know that? It's dangerous to go that fast.
Jerry's place, George and Jerry are sitting.|PING|No, no. I have green light. You jaywalked.
Jerry's place, George and Jerry are sitting.|KRAMER|(To Jerry) Hey, you watchin' Oprah?
Jerry's place, George and Jerry are sitting.|ELAINE|(To Ping) I did not jaywalk.
Jerry's place, George and Jerry are sitting.|JERRY|(To George) You're givin' him back that TV.
Jerry's place, George and Jerry are sitting.|PING|(To Elaine) Yes, you jaywalked.
Jerry's place, George and Jerry are sitting.|KRAMER|(To Jerry) No, I don't want it back.
Jerry's place, George and Jerry are sitting.|PING|(To Elaine) Jaywalker. I could slap suit on you.
Jerry's place, George and Jerry are sitting.|GEORGE|(To Jerry) We got work to do. What about the meeting?
Jerry's place, George and Jerry are sitting.|KRAMER|(To himself) Hey, look. An hour with Patrick Swayze.
George and Jerry in the NBC lobby.|JERRY|A month and a half we had. We did nothing. I can't believe we put it off until today and then we couldn't do anything because Elaine runs out to apologize to a virgin, crosses against a light, and knocks over a Chinese delivery boy. Now we're gonna make fools of ourselves, we got nothing. You're not even in show business. I gotta reputation. You drag me into the sewer with you. I've been on TV buddy boy. You know how fast word spreads in show business? It's like that (Snaps in George's face) , like that! One bad impression, you're outta the business!
George and Jerry in the NBC lobby.|GEORGE|All right, let's postpone it. Let's get out of here.
George and Jerry in the NBC lobby.|JERRY|What do you mean? They know we're here.
George and Jerry in the NBC lobby.|GEORGE|I'll fake an illness. (Acts it out) My back! My back! I can't believe, my back.
George and Jerry in the NBC lobby.|JERRY|No, no, would you get up?
George and Jerry in the NBC lobby.|GEORGE|I can do this, Jerry.
George and Jerry in the NBC lobby.|JERRY|No.
George and Jerry in the NBC lobby.|GEORGE|All right, I'll tell them my sister died. (Starts fake crying) My poor sister died. She was standing and then she was laughing and then they SHOT her! That's the kind of sick city that we're livin' in. They shoot you for laughing. I must go and comfort my poor family. Jerry, take me home so I can comfort my... my poor family.
George and Jerry in the NBC lobby.|JERRY|What?
George and Jerry in the NBC lobby.|GEORGE|That's David Letterman. I just saw David Letterman walk by. I'll be right back. (He exits)
George and Jerry in the NBC lobby.|action|Woman enters.
George and Jerry in the NBC lobby.|WOMAN|Mr. Seinfeld, they're ready for you. (She exits)
George and Jerry in the NBC lobby.|JERRY|Yes, I was very wise to hitch my wagon to his star. (Jerry enters meeting)
George and Jerry in the NBC lobby.|JERRY|Hi, how are you doing? Nice to see you all here. Hello.
George and Jerry in the NBC lobby.|RITA|Hello, Jerry. I'm Rita Kearson.
George and Jerry in the NBC lobby.|JERRY|Oh, uh, nice to meet you. Where's Russell?
George and Jerry in the NBC lobby.|RITA|He, uh, had to go to LA. There's a problem on the set of Blossom.
George and Jerry in the NBC lobby.|JERRY|Oh, poor Blossom. (He sits)
George and Jerry in the NBC lobby.|RITA|Anyway, he asked me to sit in for him.
George and Jerry in the NBC lobby.|JERRY|Oh, he ran to say something to David Letterman.
George and Jerry in the NBC lobby.|SUSAN|David Letterman's on the floor?
George and Jerry in the NBC lobby.|JERRY|Yeah, he just walked by.
George and Jerry in the NBC lobby.|RITA|Well, I think we should get started anyway.
George and Jerry in the NBC lobby.|JERRY|Yeah, good idea.
George and Jerry in the NBC lobby.|RITA|So how are you guys comin' along?
George and Jerry in the NBC lobby.|JERRY|Good, good, we've got a lot of ideas.
George and Jerry in the NBC lobby.|RITA|Good. (Pause)
George and Jerry in the NBC lobby.|JERRY|Have you ever been to a Chinese restaurant and they tell you it'll be, like, five minutes for a table and you wind up waitin' there for, like, thirty minutes? Well, we thought it would be very funny to do an entire show where all you're doin' is waitin' for the table. (They don't seem to like it) Because we've all been in that situation. You know, you're waiting... and you're hungry... and you bump into somebody you know... When is Russell coming back?
George and Jerry in the NBC lobby.|RITA|So that's the idea?
George and Jerry in the NBC lobby.|JERRY|Well no, that's one. We have many others. We have an idea where, uh, I get into an accident with a guy who has no insurance and the judge sentences him to be my butler. (Everyone laughs) You know he cooks for me, he has to cook for me... He cleans my house, he's doin' my shopping, you know? I'm walkin' around with one of those big neck collars.
George and Jerry in the NBC lobby.|GEORGE|You tellin' 'em about the butler story? Is that beautiful or what? Hey, sorry I'm late. (Looks at Rita) Russell?
George and Jerry in the NBC lobby.|RITA|I'm Rita Kearson.
George and Jerry in the NBC lobby.|GEORGE|Oh, Rita. Hey, Mr. Shermack, how're you doing, good to see you. Jay, always a pleasure. (To Susan) Sweetie. (Kisses her and then sits down next to Jerry) Yeah, yeah, that butler idea, that's beautiful. Isn't that killer? (Aside to Jerry) I thought I was getting the butler.
George and Jerry in the NBC lobby.|JERRY|Don't worry, uh, we'll find something for you.
