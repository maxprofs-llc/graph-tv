New scene - Jerry and George in Jerry's apartment later that day.|JERRY|And get this - I'm working in Atlantic City this weekend, and she's going to be down there for the pageant.
New scene - Jerry and George in Jerry's apartment later that day.|GEORGE|What if she becomes Miss America? You could be dating Miss America, Jerry!
New scene - Jerry and George in Jerry's apartment later that day.|JERRY|The only bad thing is, we have to go out with a chaperone.
New scene - Jerry and George in Jerry's apartment later that day.|GEORGE|Chaperone? What, are you kidding?
New scene - Jerry and George in Jerry's apartment later that day.|JERRY|No, it's part of the contest rules.
New scene - Jerry and George in Jerry's apartment later that day.|GEORGE|What does the chaperone do?
New scene - Jerry and George in Jerry's apartment later that day.|JERRY|I don't know, she just sits there.
New scene - Jerry and George in Jerry's apartment later that day.|GEORGE|Can she talk?
New scene - Jerry and George in Jerry's apartment later that day.|JERRY|I'm not sure if she's allowed to talk. (Picks up the phone and dials.)
New scene - Jerry and George in Jerry's apartment later that day.|GEORGE|You're calling her?
New scene - Jerry and George in Jerry's apartment later that day.|JERRY|Yeah. (sings) There she is...Miss - yes, room 417 please? Karen Hanson?
New scene - Jerry and George in Jerry's apartment later that day.|GEORGE|Hey, did you know that the Yankees don't wear cotton jerseys?
New scene - Jerry and George in Jerry's apartment later that day.|JERRY|Of course, they're polyester.
New scene - Jerry and George in Jerry's apartment later that day.|GEORGE|Well, what is that? That's a crime! Do you know how hot those things get? They should be wearing cotton.
New scene - Jerry and George in Jerry's apartment later that day.|JERRY|Why do they wear polyester?
New scene - Jerry and George in Jerry's apartment later that day.|GEORGE|I don't know. That's all gonna change.
New scene - Jerry and George in Jerry's apartment later that day.|JERRY|You're going to do something about it?
New scene - Jerry and George in Jerry's apartment later that day.|GEORGE|Why shouldn't I?
New scene - Elaine at her job interview at Doubleday with Mrs. Landis.|LANDIS|Of course, Jackie O. was a great lady. Those are going to be some tough shoes to fill. Everyone loved her. She had such...grace.
New scene - Elaine at her job interview at Doubleday with Mrs. Landis.|LANDIS|Not many people have grace.
New scene - Elaine at her job interview at Doubleday with Mrs. Landis.|ELAINE|Well, you know, grace is a tough one. I like to think I have a little grace...not as much as Jackie -
New scene - Elaine at her job interview at Doubleday with Mrs. Landis.|LANDIS|You can't have "a little grace." You either have grace, or you...don't.
New scene - Elaine at her job interview at Doubleday with Mrs. Landis.|ELAINE|O.K., fine, I have...no grace.
New scene - Elaine at her job interview at Doubleday with Mrs. Landis.|LANDIS|And you can't acquire grace.
New scene - Elaine at her job interview at Doubleday with Mrs. Landis.|ELAINE|Well, I have no intention of "getting" grace.
New scene - Elaine at her job interview at Doubleday with Mrs. Landis.|LANDIS|Grace isn't something you can pick up at the market.
New scene - Elaine at her job interview at Doubleday with Mrs. Landis.|LANDIS|Thank you for coming in.
New scene - Elaine at her job interview at Doubleday with Mrs. Landis.|ELAINE|Yeah, yeah, right.
New scene - Elaine at her job interview at Doubleday with Mrs. Landis.|LANDIS|We'll make our choice in a few days, and we'll let you know.

New scene - Elaine at her job interview at Doubleday with Mrs. Landis.|ELAINE|Justin Pitt?
New scene - Elaine at her job interview at Doubleday with Mrs. Landis.|LANDIS|He was a very close friend of Mrs. Onassis's.
New scene - Elaine at her job interview at Doubleday with Mrs. Landis.|ELAINE|"Mrs. Onassis's"? That's hard to pronounce.
New scene - Elaine at her job interview at Doubleday with Mrs. Landis.|LANDIS|Excuse me?
New scene - Elaine at her job interview at Doubleday with Mrs. Landis.|ELAINE|Nothing. (Mr. Pitt comes in with some papers in hand.)
New scene - Elaine at her job interview at Doubleday with Mrs. Landis.|PITT|Mrs. Landis, there's something wrong with this copying machine, it's all coming out slanted. Now, I don't know if this is your department or not.
New scene - Elaine at her job interview at Doubleday with Mrs. Landis.|LANDIS|Justin Pitt, this is Elaine Benes. (Elaine turns around. With sunglasses and a scarf on her head, she bears a close resemblance to Jackie O.)
New scene - Elaine at her job interview at Doubleday with Mrs. Landis.|ELAINE|I was a great admirer of Mrs. Onass-sis-sis-sis...
Cut back to Jerry's apartment; Jerry's on the phone with Miss Rhode Island.|JERRY|Hello, Karen? It's Jerry Seinfeld. Oh, that's very sweet of you. You know, you better be careful, you don't want to get too congenial. They'll slap that "Miss Congeniality" on you, and you'll congene yourself right out of the contest. So, what time do you want to get together later? What? So what, we don't need the chaperone. (To George) The chaperone can't make it. (To Karen) Oh, you're not gonna get disqualified! So, we're not going? (Kramer enters.) Hold on one second. (To Kramer) Hey, what are you doing tonight?
Cut back to Jerry's apartment; Jerry's on the phone with Miss Rhode Island.|KRAMER|Nothin.'
Cut back to Jerry's apartment; Jerry's on the phone with Miss Rhode Island.|JERRY|I'm going out with one of the Miss America contestants, you wanna go?
Cut back to Jerry's apartment; Jerry's on the phone with Miss Rhode Island.|KRAMER|What state?
Cut back to Jerry's apartment; Jerry's on the phone with Miss Rhode Island.|JERRY|Rhode Island.
Cut back to Jerry's apartment; Jerry's on the phone with Miss Rhode Island.|KRAMER|They're never in contention.
Cut back to Jerry's apartment; Jerry's on the phone with Miss Rhode Island.|GEORGE|How do you know?
Cut back to Jerry's apartment; Jerry's on the phone with Miss Rhode Island.|KRAMER|Because I've seen every Miss America pageant since I was six.
Cut back to Jerry's apartment; Jerry's on the phone with Miss Rhode Island.|JERRY|Look, do you want to go or not? I'll buy you dinner.
Cut back to Jerry's apartment; Jerry's on the phone with Miss Rhode Island.|KRAMER|Giddy-up!
New scene - Elaine and Mr. Pitt having lunch at the coffee shop.|ELAINE|Well, a lot of people have brown eyes.
New scene - Elaine and Mr. Pitt having lunch at the coffee shop.|PITT|No, there's something else. An indefinable quality.
New scene - Elaine and Mr. Pitt having lunch at the coffee shop.|ELAINE|Grace?
New scene - Elaine and Mr. Pitt having lunch at the coffee shop.|PITT|Grace, yes.
New scene - Elaine and Mr. Pitt having lunch at the coffee shop.|ELAINE|You think Ihave grace?
New scene - Elaine and Mr. Pitt having lunch at the coffee shop.|PITT|Some grace, yes.
New scene - Elaine and Mr. Pitt having lunch at the coffee shop.|ELAINE|Just some?
New scene - Elaine and Mr. Pitt having lunch at the coffee shop.|PITT|Well, you don't want too much grace or you won't be able to stand.
New scene - Elaine and Mr. Pitt having lunch at the coffee shop.|PITT|Elaine, I want you to come and work for me as my personal assistant. Now, I'll pay you the same as Pendant, but I would need you to start right away.
New scene - George approaches Buck Showalter at Yankee Stadium.|GEORGE|Hey, Buck. Talk to you for a second?

New scene - George approaches Buck Showalter at Yankee Stadium.|GEORGE|How's everything going? Everything O.K.?
New scene - George approaches Buck Showalter at Yankee Stadium.|SHOWALTER|Well, all of a sudden there's a problem with Tartabull's swing...
New scene - George approaches Buck Showalter at Yankee Stadium.|GEORGE|Listen, Buck, I uh...obviously I don't need to talk to you about the importance of player morale, but uh...I've been talking to some of the guys, and some of them - I don't want to mention any names - but some of them...they're not too happy with the polyester uniforms.
New scene - George approaches Buck Showalter at Yankee Stadium.|SHOWALTER|How so?
New scene - George approaches Buck Showalter at Yankee Stadium.|GEORGE|Well, they get very hot in the polyester. You know, it's not a natural fibre. I think they would prefer cotton.
New scene - George approaches Buck Showalter at Yankee Stadium.|SHOWALTER|Cotton, huh?
New scene - George approaches Buck Showalter at Yankee Stadium.|GEORGE|Yeah. Cotton breathes, you see, it's much softer. Imagine playing games and your team is five degrees cooler than the other team. Don't you think that would be an advantage? They're cooler, they're more comfortable...they're happier - they're gonna play better.
New scene - George approaches Buck Showalter at Yankee Stadium.|SHOWALTER|You may have something there, George.
New scene - George approaches Buck Showalter at Yankee Stadium.|GEORGE|Oh - I've got something.

New scene - Jerry and Elaine in Jerry's apartment.|JERRY|Hey, maybe you can pick me up some underwear! (Kramer enters.)
New scene - Jerry and Elaine in Jerry's apartment.|JERRY|Listen...tonight, after we finish eating, you make like you got something else to do and just "recede into the night," if you know what I mean.
New scene - Jerry and Elaine in Jerry's apartment.|KRAMER|No way!
New scene - Jerry and Elaine in Jerry's apartment.|JERRY|What?
New scene - Jerry and Elaine in Jerry's apartment.|KRAMER|Look, if you think I'm just going to step aside and do nothing while you defile this woman, you're crazy.
New scene - Jerry and Elaine in Jerry's apartment.|JERRY|I'm not going to "defile" her!
New scene - Jerry and Elaine in Jerry's apartment.|KRAMER|That's right, because I'm going to see it doesn't happen. Look, Jerry, these girls are Miss America contestants. It's every little girl's dream. And I'm not going to let you trample that dream and make a mockery of everything the pageant stands for.
New scene - Jerry and Elaine in Jerry's apartment.|JERRY|But -
New scene - Jerry and Elaine in Jerry's apartment.|JERRY|But wait a minute...
New scene - Jerry and Elaine in Jerry's apartment.|KRAMER|Now, if you want to go out and have some good, wholesome fun with a nice girl, I'd be glad to help you out...if you're looking for something more than that, you've got the wrong guy, buddy! (Jerry tries to get a word in during this entire speech, but Kramer won't budge an inch.)
New scene - Jerry and Kramer at the restaurant with Miss Rhode Island.|KRAMER|If you were Miss America, what would you do to make the world a better place?
New scene - Jerry and Kramer at the restaurant with Miss Rhode Island.|KAREN|As Miss America, I would try and bring an end to world hunger. If every person sacrificed one meal a week, there would be enough to feed the whole world!
New scene - Jerry and Kramer at the restaurant with Miss Rhode Island.|JERRY|That's a hell of a plan. (To Kramer) Listen -
New scene - Jerry and Kramer at the restaurant with Miss Rhode Island.|JERRY|Alright, Kramer!
New scene - Jerry and Kramer at the restaurant with Miss Rhode Island.|KRAMER|This is important stuff! She's got to be able to answer these questions. She's not going to have time to think, out there, with millions of people watching her. Any hesitation could cost her the crown. You know, poise counts.
New scene - Jerry and Kramer at the restaurant with Miss Rhode Island.|KAREN|You really know a lot about this, don't you?
New scene - Jerry and Kramer at the restaurant with Miss Rhode Island.|KRAMER|Oh yeah, like last year? Miss Texas? Now, she should have won easily, but she lost points in the swimsuit competition.
New scene - Jerry and Kramer at the restaurant with Miss Rhode Island.|KAREN|Well, what could she have done?
New scene - Jerry and Kramer at the restaurant with Miss Rhode Island.|KRAMER|Tape her breasts together. (Jerry is shocked.)
New scene - Jerry and Kramer at the restaurant with Miss Rhode Island.|KAREN|What else?
New scene - Jerry and Kramer at the restaurant with Miss Rhode Island.|KRAMER|Well, take you for example. Now, you're very attractive, but you got a big waist.
New scene - Jerry and Kramer at the restaurant with Miss Rhode Island.|JERRY|Hey, come on!
New scene - Jerry and Kramer at the restaurant with Miss Rhode Island.|KAREN|No, no...it's O.K. (To Kramer) Go on.
New scene - Jerry and Kramer at the restaurant with Miss Rhode Island.|KRAMER|Well, I'd recommend a waist cincher.
New scene - Jerry and Kramer at the restaurant with Miss Rhode Island.|KAREN|Really.
New scene - Jerry and Kramer at the restaurant with Miss Rhode Island.|KRAMER|Oh, yeah. Just - thip! - suck you in.
New scene - Jerry and Kramer at the restaurant with Miss Rhode Island.|JERRY|I'll be right back. (Leaves the table.)
New scene - Jerry and Kramer at the restaurant with Miss Rhode Island.|KRAMER|So, what's your talent?
New scene - Jerry and Kramer at the restaurant with Miss Rhode Island.|KAREN|Magic.
New scene - Jerry and Kramer at the restaurant with Miss Rhode Island.|KRAMER|Mmm. I'm thinking of a number from one to ten.
New scene - Jerry and Kramer at the restaurant with Miss Rhode Island.|KAREN|Six.
New scene - Jerry and Kramer at the restaurant with Miss Rhode Island.|KRAMER|No, five. But you were close.

New scene - Jerry, Karen and Kramer heading home in the limo. Kramer is still going on about the pageant.|KRAMER|Well, you got brown eyes. You want to wear a green dress.
New scene - Jerry, Karen and Kramer heading home in the limo. Kramer is still going on about the pageant.|KAREN|That makes sense. (The limo stops at Karen's hotel.)
New scene - Jerry, Karen and Kramer heading home in the limo. Kramer is still going on about the pageant.|JERRY|Well, here we are...
New scene - Jerry, Karen and Kramer heading home in the limo. Kramer is still going on about the pageant.|KAREN|Kramer, would you consider being my personal consultant for the pageant?
New scene - Jerry, Karen and Kramer heading home in the limo. Kramer is still going on about the pageant.|KRAMER|Okay. But if I'm going to do this, we play by my rules or we don't play at all.
New scene - Jerry, Karen and Kramer heading home in the limo. Kramer is still going on about the pageant.|KAREN|I am in your hands. (They shake hands.) Well! Oh, good night, Jerry. (They're about to kiss, but Kramer stops them by clearing his throat.) Kenneth will take you home. (She gets out, leaving Jerry staring at Kramer with an angry expression on his face.)

New scene - Kramer and Karen at the hotel in Atlantic City. Karen is rehearsing her stage-walking with Kramer.

If you were Miss America, and the U.S. was on the brink of a nuclear war, and the only way the conflict could be averted was if you agreed to sleep with the enemy's leader, what would you do?
New scene - Kramer and Karen at the hotel in Atlantic City. Karen is rehearsing her stage-walking with Kramer. She does it once, but Kramer isn't satisfied.|KAREN|Kramer, are these questions really that important...?
New scene - Kramer and Karen at the hotel in Atlantic City. Karen is rehearsing her stage-walking with Kramer. She does it once, but Kramer isn't satisfied.|KRAMER|Yes, they're important!
