Elaine's apartment. Jake is there and Elaine comes in.|JAKE|You got a few messages, I wrote them down.
Elaine's apartment. Jake is there and Elaine comes in.|ELAINE|Where are they?
Elaine's apartment. Jake is there and Elaine comes in.|JAKE|Lets see, they are (looking for the paper; finds it; hands it to Elaine) here they are.
Elaine's apartment. Jake is there and Elaine comes in.|ELAINE|Thank you. (looking at the messages) Oh ya, heh, I'll call you back. Ooh, Myra had the baby! Oh, my God that's wonderful! Who called?

Elaine's apartment. Jake is there and Elaine comes in.|ELAINE|I just thought you would be a little more excited about a friend of mine having a baby.
Elaine's apartment. Jake is there and Elaine comes in.|JAKE|Ok, I'm excited. I just don't happen to like exclamation points.
Elaine's apartment. Jake is there and Elaine comes in.|ELAINE|Well, you know Jake, you should learn to use them. Like the way I'm talking right now, I would put an exclamation points at the end of all these sentences! On this one! And on that one!
