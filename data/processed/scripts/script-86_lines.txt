Monk's|action|Jerry and Elaine at the normal booth
Monk's|JERRY|You got a raise?
Monk's|ELAINE|I don't fool around, (banging on the table) baby!
Monk's|JERRY|I thought you said Pendant was in financial trouble.
Monk's|ELAINE|They were, but they're being absorbed by Matsushimi, that big Japanese conglomerate.
Monk's|JERRY|Oh, when did that happen?
Monk's|ELAINE|They're signing the papers next week.
Monk's|JERRY|Does this mean they're gonna be publishing Kramer's coffee table book?
Monk's|ELAINE|Yeah, they'll definitely do it now.
Monk's|JERRY|Boy, you're on quite a streak. Job promotion, plus you're back with Jake Jarmal.
Monk's|ELAINE|Yeah, it's gettin' serious, we're talking about moving in together.
Monk's|JERRY|Boy, you really got it all, I'm sure Helen "Girlie" Brown would be very proud of you.
Monk's|action|Enter George
Monk's|JERRY|Speaking of having it all ... Where were you?
Monk's|GEORGE|I went to the beach. (Jerry and Elaine exchange looks)
Monk's|JERRY|Oh, the beach.
Monk's|action|Elaine laughs
Monk's|GEORGE|It's not working, Jerry. It's just not working. (sits down next to Elaine)
Monk's|JERRY|What is it that isn't working?
Monk's|GEORGE|Why did it all turn out like this for me? I had so much promise. I was personable, I was bright. (Elaine turns showing disagreement) Oh, maybe not academically speaking, (Elaine nods correct) I was perceptive. I always know when someone's uncomfortable at a party.
Monk's|JERRY|(pointing to napkins; to Elaine) Could I get napkin over there?
Monk's|GEORGE|It became very clear to me sitting out there today, that every decision I've ever made, in my entire life, has been wrong. My life is the complete opposite of everything I want it to be. Every instinct I have, in every of aspect of life, be it something to wear, something to eat ... It's all been wrong. (chuckles) Everywhere.
Monk's|action|A waitress comes up to George
Monk's|GEORGE|Yeah. No, no, no, wait a minute, I always have tuna on toast. Nothing's ever worked out for me with tuna on toast. I want the complete opposite of on toast. Chicken salad, on rye, un-toasted with a side of potato salad ... and a cup of tea. (laughs)
Monk's|ELAINE|Well, there's no telling what can happen from this.
Monk's|JERRY|You know chicken salad is not the opposite of tuna, salmon is the opposite of tuna, 'cuz salmon swim against the current, (hand motion of the salmon swimming against the current) and the tuna swim with it. (hand motion of the tuna swimming with it)
Monk's|GEORGE|(annoyed) Good for the tuna.
Monk's|action|A blonde looks at George
Monk's|ELAINE|Ah, George, you know, that woman just looked at you.
Monk's|GEORGE|So what? What am I supposed to do?
Monk's|ELAINE|Go talk to her.
Monk's|GEORGE|Elaine, bald men, with no jobs, and no money, who live with their parents, don't approach strange women.
Monk's|JERRY|Well here's your chance to try the opposite. Instead of tuna salad and being intimidated by women, chicken salad and going right up to them.
Monk's|GEORGE|Yeah, I should do the opposite, I should.
Monk's|JERRY|If every instinct you have is wrong, then the opposite would have to be right.
Monk's|GEORGE|Yes, I will do the opposite. I used to sit here and do nothing, and regret it for the rest of the day, so now I will do the opposite, and I will do something!
Monk's|action|He goes over to the woman
Monk's|GEORGE|Excuse me, uh I couldn't help but notice that you were looking in my direction.
Monk's|VICTORIA|Oh, yes I was, you just ordered the same exact lunch as me.
Monk's|action|George takes a deep breath

Jerry's apartment|action|The phone rings
Jerry's apartment|JERRY|Hello? What? Yeah, sure, I'll do it. I just had something cancelled the same weekend. Ok. Great. Bye. (hangs up the phone; turns to Kramer) You know, life is amazing. I just lost a job and five minutes later get another, same weekend, same money.
Jerry's apartment|KRAMER|You know who you are? Even Steven
George's car|action|George and Victoria
George's car|VICTORIA|Are you growing a beard?
George's car|GEORGE|Why shave every day? It just grows right back.
George's car|VICTORIA|I guess ...
George's car|GEORGE|I'm afraid I'm just not interested in how I present myself. If those kind of superficialities are important to you, this probably isn't gonna work.
George's car|action|A car cuts in in front of them, George has to make a sudden maneuver
George's car|VICTORIA|Hey watch, he just cut you off! Did you see that?!

Movie Theater|GEORGE|That won't be necessary.

Movie Theater|GEORGE|Shut your traps and stop kicking the seats! We're trying to watch the movie! And if I have to tell you again, we're gonna take it outside and I'm gonna show you what it's like! You understand me? Now, shut your mouths or I'll shut 'em for ya, and if you think I'm kidding, just try me. Try me. Because I would love it!
Movie Theater|action|People applaud as George sits down again
George's car|VICTORIA|Are you sure you don't wanna come up, I mean, it's only nine thirty.
George's car|GEORGE|I don't think we should. We really don't know each other very well.
George's car|VICTORIA|Who are you, George Costanza?
George's car|GEORGE|I'm the opposite of every guy you've ever met.

Hospital|JAKE|Didn't the theater manager give you the message before you went in?
Hospital|ELAINE|Yeah, he did.
Hospital|JAKE|Then when did you get those?
Hospital|ELAINE|Right after ... that ...
Hospital|JAKE|So you heard that I was in a car accident, and then decided to stop off for some Jujyfruit?
Hospital|ELAINE|Well... the counter...was right there, and...
Hospital|JAKE|I would think, under the circumstances, it would have sent you running out the building. Apparently, it didn't have any effect on you.
Hospital|ELAINE|No, no, it does!
Hospital|JAKE|(angry) If you got into a car accident, I can guarantee you I wouldn't stop for Jujyfruit!
Hospital|ELAINE|But...Jake...
Hospital|JAKE|I would like to be alone now, please.
Hospital|ELAINE|But, Jake, I didn't...

Jerry's apartment|ELAINE|Yeah, it got pretty nasty.
Jerry's apartment|JERRY|And what did you go back for? Jujyfruit?
Jerry's apartment|ELAINE|It's not like I went across the street. I bought the Jujyfruit and I got in a cab.
Jerry's apartment|JERRY|Why didn't you eat it in the cab?
Jerry's apartment|ELAINE|Because I got popcorn too, and I ate that first.

Jerry's apartment|JERRY|So you just did the opposite of everything?
Jerry's apartment|GEORGE|Yes. And listen to this, listen to this; her uncle works for the Yankees and he's gonna get me a job interview. A front office kind of thing. Assistant to the traveling secretary. A job with the New York Yankees! This has been the dream of my life ever since I was a child, and it's all happening because I'm completely ignoring every urge towards common sense and good judgment I have had. This is no longer just some crazy notion. Elaine, Jerry, this is my religion.

Mr. Lippman's office|GEORGE|Of course.
Mr. Lippman's office|GEORGE|I am different, yeah.
Mr. Lippman's office|GEORGE|Well, I wish I could say the same, but I must say, with all due respect, I find it very hard to see the logic behind some of the moves you have made with this fine organization. In the past twenty years you have caused myself, and the city of New York, a good deal of distress, as we have watched you take our beloved Yankees and reduced them to a laughing stock, all for the glorification of your massive ego!
Mr. Lippman's office|action|Cushman turns, shocked

Pendant Publishing|TINA|Well, there's been a number of complaints.
Pendant Publishing|ELAINE|Yeah? Like what?
Pendant Publishing|TINA|Well, like last Thanksgiving you buzzed up a jewel thief.
Pendant Publishing|ELAINE|Ah, I didn't know who he was!
Pendant Publishing|TINA|That's why there's a buzzer.
Pendant Publishing|ELAINE|What else?
Pendant Publishing|TINA|Well, apparently, the week after that, you buzzed up some Jehova's Witnesses and they couldn't get them out of the building.
Pendant Publishing|ELAINE|What else have you got?
Pendant Publishing|TINA|Well, let's see. (Takes out a list from her bag)

Jerry's apartment|ELAINE|Was that the ... opposite ... of what you were going to say, or was that just your natural instinct? (She squeezes George's mouth between her fingers)
Jerry's apartment|GEORGE|Instinct.
Jerry's apartment|ELAINE|Stick ... with the opposite. (Slaps George on the forehead)
