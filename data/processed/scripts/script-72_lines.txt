Opening Monologue|JERRY|The old-fashioned barber shop is unfortunately becoming a thing of the past, now what went wrong? Well first of all there's a twenty thousand dollar chair to make a three dollar tip. I say cut back on the chair, update the magazines. Why do barbers always display that license? There's no laws in hair cutting, except show every person the back of their head that's the one law. I don't want to see the back of my head. Why do I want to see something that I'm never going to see at any other time? When I buy pants two salesmen don't lift me up by the legs and go "how do you like crotch?" If I wanted to see everything I would have been a fly.

At Monk's|JERRY|What do you mean that's it?
At Monk's|GEORGE|He never finished the sentence. He got a call, that was the end of the interview.
At Monk's|JERRY|"Of course" was the last thing he said?
At Monk's|GEORGE|Maybe he was going to say "Of course I have to check with my associates."
At Monk's|ELAINE|"I want you to have this job, of course the Board of Directors is under indictment and will be serving time."
At Monk's|JERRY|"I want you to have this job, of course sodomy is a prerequisite."
At Monk's|action|Elaine laughs
At Monk's|GEORGE|All right.
At Monk's|ELAINE|Why don't you go ahead and call him?
At Monk's|GEORGE|Because he made a big deal about how I understand everything immediately. That's what impressed him.
At Monk's|JERRY|So if you call and ask if you have the job, you might lose the job.
At Monk's|GEORGE|And if I don't call...
At Monk's|JERRY|You might have the job, but you'll never know it. What kind of company is it?
At Monk's|GEORGE|Rest stop supply.

At Monk's|KRAMER|Oh course. I wouldn't let that other butcher cut my hair.
At Monk's|ELAINE|What butcher?
At Monk's|KRAMER|The uncle Enzo. That's the guy Jerry uses.
At Monk's|JERRY|Well I've been going with him for 12 years. I can't switch. I'd hurt his feelings.
At Monk's|ELAINE|You never get good haircuts.
At Monk's|KRAMER|You can get a good one today. It's Enzo's day off. Gino's there all by himself.
At Monk's|JERRY|Really?
At Monk's|ELAINE|Yeah. You know what, you should go over there and get one to look good for my bachelor auction.
At Monk's|KRAMER|What bachelor auction?
At Monk's|ELAINE|Oh it's a thing where they auction off dates with bachelors for charity.
At Monk's|KRAMER|And you didn't ask me to do it? I could raise enough money to cure polio.

At Jerry's apartment.|action|Jerry is sitting down on the couch with a really bad haircut. He is holding a mirror. Jerry and George are looking in disbelief at the haircut.
At Jerry's apartment.|GEORGE|He massacred you.
At Jerry's apartment.|JERRY|I know.
At Jerry's apartment.|GEORGE|You look like you're five years old.
At Jerry's apartment.|JERRY|What if I shampoo? Sometimes a shampoo helps.
At Jerry's apartment.|GEORGE|You've got to start seeing someone else. Get out of this relationship.
At Jerry's apartment.|JERRY|I can't. He loves me. He says I'm his most loyal customer. Plus he's right there on the corner. I'd have to pass him every day when I go by.
At Jerry's apartment.|GEORGE|Well, you gotta do it.
At Jerry's apartment.|JERRY|I can't, I can't. I'd break his heart.
At Jerry's apartment.|action|Kramer enters. He flinches when he sees the haircut.
At Jerry's apartment.|KRAMER|No way my Gino did that. It's an Enzo.
At Jerry's apartment.|JERRY|He was in the shop. I thought you told me he wasn't going to be there.
At Jerry's apartment.|KRAMER|So what?
At Jerry's apartment.|JERRY|I didn't want to hurt his feelings.
At Jerry's apartment.|KRAMER|His feelings? You can't continue seeing him. You're destroying yourself.
At Jerry's apartment.|JERRY|Yea but...
At Jerry's apartment.|KRAMER|I'm not going to let you. If you don't call him I will.
At Jerry's apartment.|JERRY|No, no Kramer. I don't want you to do that. You can't do that.

At Jerry's apartment.|JERRY|Yeah?
At Jerry's apartment.|GEORGE|I show up.
At Jerry's apartment.|JERRY|What do you mean you show up?
At Jerry's apartment.|GEORGE|I show up. I pretend I have the job. The guy's on vacation. If I have the job, it's fine. If I don't have the job, by the time he comes back, I'm ensconced.
At Jerry's apartment.|JERRY|Hmm. Not bad.
At Jerry's apartment.|GEORGE|What's the worst thing that could happen?
At Jerry's apartment.|JERRY|Well, you'd be embarrassed and humiliated in front of a large group of people and have to walk out in shame with your tail between your legs.
At Jerry's apartment.|GEORGE|Yeah, so?
At Jerry's apartment.|JERRY|Yeah, I see what you mean. I forgot who I was dealing with here.
