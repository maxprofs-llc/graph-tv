Jerry's apartment|JERRY|Oh, yeah. Right. Like anybody's ever gonna do this! How did you get me to go along with that? A show about nothing!

Street|LEO|He used to be in the pajama business. I used to be able to get pajamas for free. I used to come over and get pajamas all the time!
Street|action|Leo shakes Jerry around using his grip on Jerry's arm.
Street|JERRY|Oh, yeah, yeah. I remember.
Street|action|George gets impatient, touches his watch subtly, maybe subconsciously.
Street|LEO|The funny thing is: I can't wear 'em. I get too hot. I sleep in my underwear and a t-shirt. If it gets too hot, I just get the t-shirt off! Anyway, Danny says to me: 'You need any pajamas?'
Street|JERRY|(interrupts) I-I'm sorry Uncle Leo, I really gotta get going.
Street|LEO|Oh. Well. You gotta get going, so go.

Courtroom|NEWMAN|I had gone up to Westchester. I go there every Tuesday. I do charity for the blind in my spare time for the Lighthouse. I was in the middle of a game of Parcheesi with an old blind man and I excused myself to call my friend as he was very depressed lately because he never became a banker.
Courtroom|JUDGE|I don't understand.
Courtroom|NEWMAN|You see, it'd been his lifelong dream to be a banker and he uh, just the day before he was turned down by another bank. I believe it was the Manufacturer's Hanover on Lexington and 40th Street. That was the third bank to turn him down so I was-I was a little concerned. I wanted to see how he was doing. Well, Your Honor, he was barely audible. But I distinctly recall him say...
Courtroom|KRAMER|(interupts involuntarily) Yo-yo Ma!
Courtroom|NEWMAN|So I sped home to save my friend's life and I was stopped for speeding. Yes, I admit I was speeding but it was to save a man's life. A close friend. An innocent person who wanted nothing more out of life than to love, to be loved and to be a banker.
Courtroom|JUDGE|So then he didn't kill himself.
Courtroom|NEWMAN|No sir. He did not. But only by thge grace of God. He's in the courtroom today

Courtroom|KRAMER|All right.
Courtroom|NEWMAN|Okay.
Courtroom|KRAMER|(to Judge) I was very upset that day because I could never become a banker.
Courtroom|NEWMAN|And that failure to become a banker was eating at you. Eating-eating-eating at you inside.
Courtroom|KRAMER|(not convincing) Uh, yeah.
Courtroom|NEWMAN|It was your family that pushed you into banking , it was their dream for you...
Courtroom|JUDGE|Mister Newman.
Courtroom|NEWMAN|Your Honor, I'm only trying to establish Mister Kramer's fragile emotional state, my entire case depends on it.
Courtroom|JUDGE|Uh, continue.

Courtroom|KRAMER|What was the question?
Courtroom|NEWMAN|You're telling how your parents pushed you into banking.
Courtroom|KRAMER|Uh, well, my father when I was a kid, he took me to the bank and he lifted me up and he pointed to the teller and he said: 'Sonny boy, take a good look at him, that's gonna be you some day.'
Courtroom|NEWMAN|But you never became a banker, did you Mister Kramer? Why? Why did you fail?
Courtroom|KRAMER|I don't know.
Courtroom|NEWMAN|It was because you hated your father and you would do anything to displease him. Isn't THAT true?
Courtroom|JUDGE|Uh, could you get to the speeding?
Courtroom|NEWMAN|Yuh, yes. I intend to Your Honor. And then, on the afternoon of September 10th, you received a phone call did you not?
