Setting: Monk's Coffee shop|JERRY|(To Elaine) Let me ask you a question.
Setting: Monk's Coffee shop|ELAINE|Mm-hm.
Setting: Monk's Coffee shop|JERRY|You're a hostage, captured by terrorists-
Setting: Monk's Coffee shop|ELAINE|(Smiling, chewing) Who, me?
Setting: Monk's Coffee shop|JERRY|You, anybody - whatever. You're in the little room, you're chained to the floor, you're there for a long time.. do you think they would ever consider doing the laundry?
Setting: Monk's Coffee shop|ELAINE|(Matter-of-factly) They have to, it's in the Geneva Convention.
Setting: Monk's Coffee shop|KRAMER|(Imitating a Turkish terrorist) You! Take off your socks, your pants, your underwear. We're doing the wash. C'mon! Take it off, take it off!
Setting: Monk's Coffee shop|action|Jerry and Elaine both laugh at Kramer's impression as George slowly enters. He's in a melancholy state
Setting: Monk's Coffee shop|KRAMER|Hey, Georgie.
Setting: Monk's Coffee shop|action|George sits down next to Elaine - opposite Kramer
Setting: Monk's Coffee shop|JERRY|(To George) What's the matter?
Setting: Monk's Coffee shop|GEORGE|(Slowly shakes his head) My mother caught me.
Setting: Monk's Coffee shop|JERRY|"Caught" you? Doing what?
Setting: Monk's Coffee shop|GEORGE|You know. (All three give him blank stares) I was alone..
Setting: Monk's Coffee shop|ELAINE|(Making a face of surprise) You mean..?!
Setting: Monk's Coffee shop|GEORGE|(Nods) Uh-huh.
Setting: Monk's Coffee shop|KRAMER|(Laughing) She caught you?
Setting: Monk's Coffee shop|action|Elaine laughs with Kramer
Setting: Monk's Coffee shop|JERRY|Where?
Setting: Monk's Coffee shop|GEORGE|(Not really wanting to embellish) ..I stopped by the house to drop the car off, and I went inside for a few minutes.. Nobody was there - they're supposed to be working. (Jerry and Elaine look at each other - enjoying the story) My mother had a Glamour magazine, I started leafing through it..
Setting: Monk's Coffee shop|JERRY|"Glamour"?
Setting: Monk's Coffee shop|action|Kramer and Elaine laugh slightly
Setting: Monk's Coffee shop|GEORGE|..So, one thing lead to another..
Setting: Monk's Coffee shop|JERRY|So, what did she do?
Setting: Monk's Coffee shop|GEORGE|First she screams, "George, what are you doing?! My God!" And it looked like she was gonna faint - she started clutching the wall, trying to hang onto it.
Setting: Monk's Coffee shop|KRMAER|(Reflecting on the story so far) Man..
Setting: Monk's Coffee shop|GEORGE|I didn't know whether to try and keep her from falling, or zip up.
Setting: Monk's Coffee shop|JERRY|What did you do?
Setting: Monk's Coffee shop|GEORGE|I zipped up!
Setting: Monk's Coffee shop|ELAINE|(Wide-eyed) So, she fell?
Setting: Monk's Coffee shop|GEORGE|Yeah. (Noticing this makes him out to be the bad kid, he gets defensive) Well, I couldn't run over there the way I was!
Setting: Monk's Coffee shop|ELAINE|No, I guess you couldn't have..
Setting: Monk's Coffee shop|JERRY|(In the middle of Elaine's sentence, smiling) No, I wouldn't think so.
Setting: Monk's Coffee shop|ELAINE|(Finishing it off) ..done that.
Setting: Monk's Coffee shop|GEORGE|So, she fell, and then she started screaming, "My back! My back!" So, I picked her up and took her to the hospital.
Setting: Monk's Coffee shop|ELAINE|(Between chuckles) How is she?
Setting: Monk's Coffee shop|GEORGE|(Somewhat angered) She's in traction.
Setting: Monk's Coffee shop|ELAINE|(Still laughing) Ok, I'm sorry.
Setting: Monk's Coffee shop|GEORGE|It's not funny, Elaine.
Setting: Monk's Coffee shop|ELAINE|(Stifling her laughter) I know. I'm sorry. I'm serious.
Setting: Monk's Coffee shop|GEORGE|Her back went out. She's gotta be there for a couple of days. All she said on the way over in the car was, "Why, George, why?!".. I said, "Because it's there!"
Setting: Monk's Coffee shop|action|Kramer laughs, sipping his drink
Setting: Monk's Coffee shop|JERRY|"Glamour"?
Setting: Monk's Coffee shop|action|Elaine laughs
Setting: Monk's Coffee shop|GEORGE|(Vowing) Well, I'll tell you this, though - I am never doing.. that , again.
Setting: Monk's Coffee shop|ELAINE|What, you mean, in your mother's house, or all together?
Setting: Monk's Coffee shop|GEORGE|(Definite) All together.
Setting: Monk's Coffee shop|action|The next three lines are said at the exact same time
Setting: Monk's Coffee shop|ELAINE|Oh, gimme a break..
Setting: Monk's Coffee shop|JERRY|(Skeptical) Ohhh yeah.. right.
Setting: Monk's Coffee shop|KRAMER|Oh, like you're gonna stop?
Setting: Monk's Coffee shop|GEORGE|You don't think I can?
Setting: Monk's Coffee shop|JERRY|No chance.
Setting: Monk's Coffee shop|GEORGE|(Daring) You think you could?
Setting: Monk's Coffee shop|JERRY|Well, I know I could hold out longer than you.
Setting: Monk's Coffee shop|GEORGE|Care to make it interesting?
Setting: Monk's Coffee shop|JERRY|Sure, how much?
Setting: Monk's Coffee shop|GEORGE|A hundred dollars.
Setting: Monk's Coffee shop|JERRY|(Pointing) You're on.
Setting: Monk's Coffee shop|KRAMER|(Butting in) Wait a second, wait a second. Count me in on this. (Clicks his tongue)
Setting: Monk's Coffee shop|JERRY|You?
Setting: Monk's Coffee shop|KRAMER|Yeah.
Setting: Monk's Coffee shop|JERRY|You'll be out before we get the check.
Setting: Monk's Coffee shop|ELAINE|(Smiling) I want to be in on this, too.
Setting: Monk's Coffee shop|ELAINE|Why?
Setting: Monk's Coffee shop|JERRY|(Showing difference) It's apples and oranges..
Setting: Monk's Coffee shop|ELAINE|What? Why? (More 'no, no, no's from Jerry and George. Persistent) Why?
Setting: Monk's Coffee shop|JERRY|Because you're a woman!
Setting: Monk's Coffee shop|ELAINE|So what?
Setting: Monk's Coffee shop|JERRY|It's easier for a woman not to do it than a man.
Setting: Monk's Coffee shop|ELAINE|(Sarcastic) Oh.
Setting: Monk's Coffee shop|JERRY|We have to do it. It's part of our lifestyle. It's like, uh.. shaving.
Setting: Monk's Coffee shop|ELAINE|Oh, that is such bologna. I shave my legs.
Setting: Monk's Coffee shop|KRAMER|(Making a point) Not everyday.
Setting: Monk's Coffee shop|GEORGE|Alright, look, you want to be in?
Setting: Monk's Coffee shop|ELAINE|Yeah!
Setting: Monk's Coffee shop|GEORGE|You gotta give us odds. At least two to one - you gotta put up two-hundred dollars.
Setting: Monk's Coffee shop|KRAMER|No, a thousand!
Setting: Monk's Coffee shop|ELAINE|No, I'll - I'll put up one-fifty.
Setting: Monk's Coffee shop|GEORGE|Alright, you're in for one-fifty.
Setting: Monk's Coffee shop|JERRY|(Nodding) Okay, one-fifty.
Setting: Monk's Coffee shop|GEORGE|Alright, now, how are we gonna monitor this thing?
Setting: Monk's Coffee shop|JERRY|Well, obviously, we all know each other very well, (Elaine slightly laughs) I'm sure that we'll all feel comfortable within the confines of the honor system.
Setting: Monk's Coffee shop|KRAMER|Alright. (Holds out his pinkie at the center of the table)

Yes, of course I'm gonna come by. Alright. (Hangs up, slamming it down on the coffee table. He sits down next to Jerry) My mother wants me to see a psychiatrist now. Why?! Because she caught me?

Setting: Jerry's apartment|KRAMER|..Yeah.. (Pause) yeah.. (Slowly stands up, and walks out Jerry's apartment - leaving Jerry and George with the view, he shuts the door behind him)
Setting: Jerry's apartment|JERRY|Hey, let me ask you a question. In these nudist colonies, do they eat naked in the dining room?
Setting: Jerry's apartment|GEORGE|I would imagine it's all naked.
Setting: Jerry's apartment|JERRY|What about the chamber maids? Are they naked, too?
Setting: Jerry's apartment|GEORGE|(Still focused on the nudist) They're naked, the gardeners naked.. the bellhops. (Jerry makes a noise of astonishment) One big nude-a-rama.
