Jerry and Uncle Leo at Monk's coffee shop.|JERRY|He has no idea who you are.
Jerry and Uncle Leo at Monk's coffee shop.|JERRY|All right. Anyway, the point I was making before Goerbbles made your hamburger is a man like you could be dating women twenty years younger. C'mon Uncle Leo, I've seen the way women look at you. When's the last time you looked in a mirror? You're an Adonis! You've got beautiful features, lovely skin, you're in the prime of your life here, you should be swinging. If I were you I'd tell this Lydia character, "It's been real," move back into that bachelor pad and put out a sign; Open for business.
Jerry and Uncle Leo at Monk's coffee shop.|JERRY|Well, keep looking.
Elaine and Mr. Peterman at work.|PETERMAN|I'm afraid I have some bad news, Elaine. It appears you will not be accompanying me to Africa.

Elaine and Mr. Peterman at work.|PETERMAN|That's right, Elaine. White lotus. Yam-yam. Shanghai Sally.

Elaine and Mr. Peterman at work.|PETERMAN|Not a chance. I'm afraid I'll just have to find someone else to accompany me on my journey. The dark continent is no place for an addict, Elaine.
Elaine and Mr. Peterman at work.|ELAINE|Obviously, Mr. Peterman, there's something wrong with this test. I don't take opium. Let me take another one, please? I'll call the doctor right now, I'll take a pop urine test.
Elaine and Mr. Peterman at work.|PETERMAN|All right, Elaine.

Kramer, in the shower|action|He's got the Commando 450 shower head hooked up. He turns it on, the water shoots out full blast and knocks him backwards. He grabs the shower curtain for support and tries to reach forward to turn the faucet off, but the force of the water is too great, he only succeeds in knocking over a few shampoo bottles. Kramer is eventually pushed back enough by the water to become entangled in the shower curtain until he eventually falls out of the shower, and out of camera range.
