INT JERRY'S APARTMENT|KRAMER|Jerry wake up to reality. It's a military thing. They're probably creating a whole army of pig warriors.
INT JERRY'S APARTMENT|GEORGE|I tell you something. I wish there were pig-men. You get a few of these pig-men walking around suddenly I'm looking a whole lot better. Then if somebody wants to fix me up at least they could say, "Hey he's no pig-man!"
INT JERRY'S APARTMENT|JERRY|Believe me, there'd be plenty of women going for these pig-men. Whatever the deformity is there's always some group of perverts that's attracted to it. "Oo that little tail really turns me on."
